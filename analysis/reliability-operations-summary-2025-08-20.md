## Architecture Comparison Summary

Based on the collected data, **separated database architectures demonstrate clear operational advantages**:

1. **Better Cache Performance**: Higher hit rates and faster warm-up times
2. **Superior Backup/Recovery**: More efficient backup processes and faster recovery
3. **Improved Availability**: Higher SLA commitments with better RPO/RTO achievements
4. **Operational Resilience**: Better isolation of failure domains and recovery patterns

The data supports the thesis that compute-storage separation provides measurable operational benefits beyond just cost and scalability advantages.
