# Research Papers

This collection explores the fundamental shifts reshaping the database and data infrastructure landscape. Our research analyzes the technological, economic, and strategic forces driving the transition from fragmented, specialized systems to unified, storage-centric architectures.

## Published Papers

### [The Shift Towards a Unified Foundation](/research/unified-foundation/)
*Prepared by: Patrick McFadin*

The data management landscape is undergoing a paradigm shift, moving decisively away from fragmented, database-centric architectures toward a unified, storage-centric model. This paper analyzes the technological drivers and strategic implications of this transformation, examining how object storage, open table formats, and multi-model databases are reshaping the industry.

**Key Topics:**
- Storage-centric stack with S3 and Parquet as foundation
- Multi-model database consolidation 
- Query language homogenization and interoperability
- Apache Iceberg as a cornerstone technology
- Economic and strategic implications of decoupling compute from storage

### [The Unified Horizon: Analyzing the 2030 Trajectory of Multi-API Data Platforms](/research/unified-horizon/)
*Prepared by: Patrick McFadin*

An analysis of the enterprise data landscape's trajectory toward unified multi-API data platforms, projecting a 2030 horizon where they become mainstream. This whitepaper examines the technological feasibility, economic drivers, and organizational challenges shaping this transition from polyglot persistence to unified platforms.

**Key Topics:**
- Timeline feasibility for unified platform adoption by 2030
- Developer velocity acceleration through unified access
- Total cost of ownership reduction strategies
- API productization and platform business models
- Organizational hurdles and change management

## Research Themes

Our research spans five critical areas driving the post-database era:

1. **Bespoke DB Era Trends** - The evolution from specialized databases to multi-model platforms
2. **Storage Infrastructure** - S3-compatible APIs and open table formats like Iceberg
3. **Access Pattern Consolidation** - Unified APIs spanning SQL, key-value, document, graph, and search
4. **Syntax Homogenization** - Standardization around ISO GQL, SQL:2023, and JSONPath
5. **Interoperability Layers** - Query engines enabling cross-platform data access

## About This Research

This research is part of the broader **Post-Database Era** project, which examines how the database industry is evolving from a collection of specialized, siloed systems toward an integrated, open, and storage-centric future. Our analysis synthesizes industry trends, vendor roadmaps, case studies, and emerging standards to provide insights for technical and business leaders navigating this transformation.
