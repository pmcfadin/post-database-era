# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - All required fields populated"
  sample_size: "3 incidents (expanding to 100+)"
  confidence: "High - Based on official postmortems"
  limitations: 
    - "Limited to publicly available postmortems"
    - "Bias toward major incidents that get public attention"
    - "Self-reported data from organizations"
    - "Subjective coding of architecture impact"

# Coding Guidelines
coding_methodology:
  architecture_impact_scale:
    positive: "Separated architecture would likely have reduced impact/MTTR"
    neutral: "Separated architecture would not significantly change outcome"
    negative: "Separated architecture would likely have increased complexity/MTTR"
  evidence_extraction:
    max_words: 15
    focus: "Technical details supporting architecture impact assessment"
  inter_rater_agreement:
    target: "κ > 0.75 (substantial agreement)"
    method: "Dual coding of sample incidents"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "This is an initial template dataset - expand to 100+ incidents for statistical significance"
  - "Focus on database service incidents, not general infrastructure"
  - "Code conservatively - when in doubt, mark as Neutral"
  - "Validate coding against actual architectural details when available"
  - "Consider creating separate datasets by failure domain for deeper analysis"
