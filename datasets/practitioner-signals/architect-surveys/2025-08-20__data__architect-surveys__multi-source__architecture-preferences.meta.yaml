# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - All fields populated"
  sample_size: "5 responses (representative sample)"
  confidence: "Medium - Based on survey synthesis"
  limitations: 
    - "Small sample size - expand to statistical significance"
    - "Potential response bias toward early adopters"
    - "Synthesized from public sources, not direct survey"
    - "Self-reported preference may differ from actual adoption"

# Quantitative Conversion Methodology

# Survey Methodology Notes
survey_design:
  target_population: "Database architects, platform engineers, DBAs, SREs"
  sampling_method: "Industry survey participants from major tech surveys"
  response_validation: "Cross-reference with public case studies where possible"
  bias_considerations:
    - "Technology conference attendees may favor newer architectures"
    - "Large company bias in survey participation"
    - "Self-selection bias toward experienced practitioners"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "This is a template/pilot dataset - expand to 200+ responses for statistical power"
  - "Consider stratified sampling by company size and industry"
  - "Validate quantitative scales with practitioner review"
  - "Track architecture preference changes over time (longitudinal study)"
  - "Consider adding regional/cultural factors in future iterations"
