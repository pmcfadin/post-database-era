# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all major cloud database free tiers covered"
  sample_size: "15 vendors representing >80% of cloud database market"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Based on current documentation, may change without notice"
    - "Steps count may vary based on user's existing AWS/Azure/GCP setup"
    - "Some vendors offer multiple getting started paths"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Gateway approach means vendor presents multiple API options upfront"
  - "Single API approach means vendor has one primary interface in quickstart"
  - "Steps counted are minimal path to execute first query, not comprehensive setup"
  - "Azure Cosmos DB and DataStax Astra are primary gateway-first approaches"
  - "Most traditional vendors (AWS individual services, MongoDB) use single API approach"
