# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all target vendors and features covered"
  sample_size: "8 vendors, 12 services, 144 feature mappings"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Focuses on core database operations, not service management APIs"
  - "Status reflects public cloud service availability, not on-premises versions"
  - "Full text search implementations vary significantly across vendors"
  - "Transaction scope and ACID guarantees differ between services"
  - "Consistency models may have different performance implications"
