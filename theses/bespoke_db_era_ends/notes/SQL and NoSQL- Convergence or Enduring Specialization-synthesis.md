The sources present a nuanced disagreement regarding the extent to which SQL and NoSQL document databases are truly converging, highlighting both the significant strides made towards unification and the enduring reasons for specialized roles.

### SQL and NoSQL Document Stores are Converging

The prevailing view suggests a strong convergence between SQL and NoSQL document stores, driven by the adoption of common standards and multi-model database approaches. Over the last decade, major relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle have **added robust native JSON support**, including dedicated JSON data types and functions aligned with SQL:2016 and SQL:2023 standards. This has blurred the lines between relational and document databases, allowing SQL databases to store and query schemaless JSON data efficiently. Simultaneously, NoSQL document databases such as Couchbase and Azure Cosmos DB have incorporated SQL-like querying methods, making them more accessible to SQL-trained developers. The IETF's 2024 publication of **JSONPath (RFC 9535) is further standardizing JSON query syntax**, aiming for uniform behavior across all platforms, thereby enhancing portability. This overall trend means the gap between traditional relational and document systems has significantly narrowed, fostering simpler data architectures and lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by reducing the need for multiple specialized systems.

*   "The **majority of new database systems launched from 2026 onward are likely to be multi-model** rather than narrowly focused, aiming to handle relational, document, graph, key–value, and even analytical workloads within one platform."
*   "**PostgreSQL and MySQL, for instance, added native JSON document types**, XML, key–value extensions, and more over the past decade... **from the application developer’s perspective, the gap between a “relational” and “NoSQL” database is much less stark than it was a decade ago**."

### Specialized Document Databases Have an Enduring Role (or Convergence Has Limits)

Conversely, some sources caution that the convergence is not absolute and specialized document databases will retain an enduring role due to their inherent strengths and certain limitations of multi-model approaches. While relational databases now support JSON, they **may not offer the same flexibility or performance as native document stores** when handling massive JSON workloads or truly ad-hoc, schema-less queries. Specialized document databases are purpose-built for these scenarios and can still deliver superior performance. Furthermore, multi-model databases, in their attempt to be "everything to everyone," run the risk of **"not being really good at anything"**, potentially making compromises in functionality or performance for specific data models. This can lead to a less optimized developer experience compared to a dedicated system. Despite standardization efforts, JSONPath implementation gaps persist, meaning **not all databases immediately conform to the new RFC 9535 standard**, leading to potential inconsistencies in query behavior across different engines as of 2025. Moreover, major cloud providers like Amazon continue to **advocate for "purpose-built databases,"** implying that specialized services, including document databases, will remain distinct offerings to avoid compromises associated with converged solutions.

*   "**Relational databases can now store and query JSON, but that doesn’t always equal the flexibility or performance of native document stores.** For instance, scaling massive JSON workloads or doing ad-hoc schema-less queries might still be easier in MongoDB or Couchbase which are purpose-built for JSON."
*   "I am fearful of **multi-model databases ending up conflicting with their own feature sets and not being really good at anything**."
*   "Even though RFC 9535 is out, not all databases immediately conformed. For example, **SQL Server’s JSON implementation still doesn’t support JSONPath filter expressions as of 2025**, and it may not incorporate the new standard soon."
