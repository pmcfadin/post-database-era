The sources present a nuanced disagreement regarding the extent to which vendor-specific extensions in database query languages are declining. While there is a clear trend toward homogenization and standardization, certain areas and use cases continue to see proprietary features persist.

### Vendor-Specific Extensions are Declining

The sources indicate a strong trend towards the decline of vendor-specific database extensions, driven by a desire for greater portability and reduced lock-in. **Modern applications and new database systems increasingly prioritize widely supported SQL features and standard APIs**, with developers often achieving 80% or more functionality using standard SQL. SQL standards like **SQL:2023 are incorporating features that were once proprietary**, such as enhanced JSON support and common functions, effectively homogenizing syntax across major engines. New languages like ISO GQL for graph databases and IETF JSONPath for JSON querying are creating industry-wide standards, moving away from fragmented dialects and improving cross-engine compatibility. This shift is further propelled by **cloud vendors emphasizing API compatibility over proprietary engine names**, and open-source adoption, making it easier to switch underlying databases without rewriting application code.

**Strongest Citations:**

*   "**Vendor-specific SQL extensions appear to be receding in new development**. Modern applications increasingly rely on widely supported SQL features and ORMs/abstraction layers to remain database-agnostic."
*   "The **majority of new database systems launched from 2026 onward are likely to be multi-model** rather than narrowly focused, aiming to handle relational, document, graph, key–value, and even analytical workloads within one platform."
*   "The **SQL standard’s latest evolution, SQL:2023**, introduced features like property graph queries and enhanced JSON support, **codifying many functions**... that had long existed as vendor extensions."

### Vendor-Specific Extensions Persist

Conversely, sources caution that the decline of vendor-specific extensions is not absolute, and they persist in several critical areas. **Procedural SQL dialects (such as Oracle’s PL/SQL, SQL Server’s T-SQL, and PostgreSQL’s PL/pgSQL) remain distinctly different**, requiring substantial rewriting for cross-platform migration, and show little evidence of convergence. Additionally, cloud data warehouses and traditional relational databases continue to offer **unique, powerful proprietary functions for advanced analytics, machine learning, or specialized data types** (e.g., BigQuery's ML.PREDICT, Snowflake's FLATTEN, Oracle's MODEL clause) that lack standard equivalents. Furthermore, **no database is fully compliant with the latest SQL standards**, and a lag in adopting new ones like JSONPath means that subtle differences in default behaviors, optimizer hints, and partial feature support can still cause portability issues for complex queries.

**Strongest Citations:**

*   "**Stored Procedures and Procedural SQL Dialects: ... Oracle’s PL/SQL, SQL Server’s T-SQL, and PostgreSQL’s PL/pgSQL remain quite different.** A stored procedure written in PL/SQL will not run on SQL Server or Postgres without substantial rewriting..."
*   "**Vendor-Specific Analytics/Extensions**: Google BigQuery has SQL extensions for machine learning (ML.PREDICT) and geospatial analysis... Snowflake has proprietary functions... Oracle’s MODEL clause... Microsoft’s T-SQL has things like... specialized window function extensions."
*   "**Lack of Universal Compliance:** No database is fully compliant with SQL:2016 or SQL:2023. Each skips certain optional features or deviates... For example, SQL Server’s JSON implementation still doesn’t support JSONPath filter expressions as of 2025."
