# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for all operational cost fields"
  sample_size: "20 Apache Atlas deployments across industries"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Staff costs vary significantly by geography and skill level"
    - "Infrastructure costs depend on cloud provider and region"
    - "Operational overhead varies with automation maturity"
    - "Some deployments may have shared infrastructure costs"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Atlas requires significant operational expertise compared to SaaS solutions"
  - "Cost per asset decreases dramatically with scale due to fixed infrastructure overhead"
  - "Staff costs often represent 50-70% of total operational expenses"
  - "HBase and Solr operational complexity adds significant overhead"
  - "Enterprise deployments often require dedicated Atlas administrators"
  - "Kafka cluster sizing critical for performance and cost optimization"
  - "Storage costs grow linearly with metadata volume and retention"
  - "Network costs can be significant in multi-datacenter deployments"
