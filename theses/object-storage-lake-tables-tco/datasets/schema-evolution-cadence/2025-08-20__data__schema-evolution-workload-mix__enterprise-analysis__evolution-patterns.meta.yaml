# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for all core schema evolution metrics"
  sample_size: "22 organizations across 10 industry verticals"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations:
    - "Modeled data based on observed industry patterns"
    - "Schema change frequency varies significantly by organization maturity"
    - "Cost models simplified - actual migration costs highly variable"
    - "Breaking change percentages represent steady-state averages"
    - "Does not account for major platform migrations or rewrites"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Case studies represent realistic enterprise schema evolution patterns"
  - "Sensitivity analysis explores impact of workload composition"
  - "BI-heavy workloads: fewer changes, more breaking changes, higher downtime"
  - "ETL-heavy workloads: moderate, predictable evolution patterns"
  - "ML-heavy workloads: frequent changes, mostly additive/non-breaking"
  - "Migration costs typically 2-8% of total TCO"
  - "Schema complexity correlates with ML workload percentage"
  - "Evolution agility inversely correlated with breaking change percentage"
