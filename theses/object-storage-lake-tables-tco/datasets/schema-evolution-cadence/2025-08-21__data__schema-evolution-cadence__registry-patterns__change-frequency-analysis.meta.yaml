# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Enterprise organizations show lower breaking change percentages"
  - "Startups have higher breaking change rates but faster iteration"
  - "Automated validation correlates with better compatibility maintenance"
  - "Cloud-managed registries generally show better recovery times"
  - "Change frequency trends vary by organization maturity"
  - "Mandatory review processes reduce breaking change percentages"
