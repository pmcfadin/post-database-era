# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - All cross-border scenarios properly modeled"
  sample_size: "240 scenarios across major regulatory jurisdictions"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Based on current regulatory frameworks as of 2025"
    - "Compliance costs may vary significantly with specific business requirements"
    - "Does not include legal consultation costs or implementation services"
    - "Policy object scaling is estimated based on data volume and sensitivity heuristics"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Covers US-EU, EU-APAC, and US-APAC cross-border scenarios"
  - "Includes GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, and PIPEDA regulatory frameworks"
  - "Data types include PII, Financial, Healthcare, and Generic classifications"
  - "Stack types range from basic async replication to zero-trust multi-region architectures"
  - "Governance overhead ranges from 25% to 60% of base replication costs"
  - "Policy objects scale with data volume, sensitivity, and number of applicable regulations"
  - "Costs increase significantly with data sensitivity and regulatory complexity"
