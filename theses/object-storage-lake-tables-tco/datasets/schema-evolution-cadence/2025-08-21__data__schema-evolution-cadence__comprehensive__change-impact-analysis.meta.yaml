# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all records complete"
  sample_size: "30 schema evolution events"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Anonymized data - specific organization names removed"
    - "Recovery times may include manual intervention delays"
    - "Some events may have multiple contributing factors"
    - "Limited to 2024 data timeframe"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Breaking changes show significantly higher failure rates and recovery times"
  - "Forward-compatible changes (additive) typically have zero downstream failures"
  - "Enterprise organizations tend to have more robust recovery strategies"
  - "Table format capabilities vary significantly in schema evolution support"
  - "Semantic versioning approaches show better failure management"
  - "Timeline includes both planned and unplanned schema changes"
