# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - All required fields populated"
  sample_size: "187 scenarios across 3 major cloud providers"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Costs based on published pricing, actual costs may vary with enterprise discounts"
    - "Compliance costs estimated from industry studies, actual implementation costs vary"
    - "Policy object counts are estimated based on data volume and complexity heuristics"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Covers AWS, Azure, and GCP multi-region scenarios"
  - "Includes GDPR and SOX compliance cost models"
  - "Disaster recovery scenarios with varying RPO/RTO requirements"
  - "Governance overhead calculated as 15-25% of base replication costs"
  - "Policy objects scale with data volume and regulatory complexity"
  - "Cross-continent scenarios include additional latency and cost penalties"
