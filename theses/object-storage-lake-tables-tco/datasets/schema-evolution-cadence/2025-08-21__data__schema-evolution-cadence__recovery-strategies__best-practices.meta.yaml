# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all strategies documented"
  sample_size: "20 recovery strategies"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Success rates based on industry averages - specific results vary"
    - "Recovery times depend on system scale and complexity"
    - "Automation levels vary by tooling and organization maturity"
    - "Cost complexity relative to organization size and resources"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Proactive strategies generally have higher success rates but longer implementation times"
  - "Automated strategies show faster recovery times and higher consistency"
  - "High-skill strategies are more effective but less broadly applicable"
  - "Rollback safety inversely correlates with data transformation complexity"
  - "Monitoring requirements increase with strategy sophistication"
  - "Zero-downtime strategies require significant upfront investment"
