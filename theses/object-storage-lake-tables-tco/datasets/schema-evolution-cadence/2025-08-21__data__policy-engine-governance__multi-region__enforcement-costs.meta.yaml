# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - All policy engine deployment scenarios modeled"
  sample_size: "100 scenarios across 5 policy engine types and 4 deployment patterns"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Based on current policy engine architectures and capabilities"
    - "Evaluation costs estimated from typical access patterns"
    - "Does not include custom policy development costs"
    - "Cross-region sync costs may vary with actual network topology"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Policy engine types range from Basic RBAC to ML-Enhanced Governance"
  - "Deployment patterns include Primary-DR, Multi-Active, Global-Mesh, and Edge-Distributed"
  - "Data volumes range from 1TB to 1PB under governance"
  - "Policy evaluations scale from 500K to 200M per month"
  - "Complexity factors account for policy sophistication and evaluation overhead"
  - "Multi-region replication costs increase significantly with region count"
  - "Latency penalties apply for cross-region policy synchronization"
  - "Advanced policy engines (ML-Enhanced, Zero-Trust) have substantially higher costs"
