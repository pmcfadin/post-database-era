# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all tool/format combinations assessed"
  sample_size: "14 tools across 3 table formats = 42 combinations"
  confidence: "high - based on official vendor documentation"
  limitations: 
    - "Support status may change rapidly as features mature"
    - "Connector-based support depends on underlying database capabilities"
    - "Some tools have format support through intermediate engines"
    - "Write support often requires specific configurations"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Iceberg shows strongest ecosystem support (92.9% read, 57.1% write)"
  - "Delta Lake has good read support (78.6%) but limited write support (42.9%)"
  - "Hudi has minimal direct tool support (14.3% read, 0% write)"
  - "BI tools typically access formats through analytics engines rather than directly"
  - "ELT platforms show varying support patterns based on destination capabilities"
  - "Analytics engines provide the foundation for format support in the broader ecosystem"
  - "Query pushdown capabilities vary significantly across tool categories"
