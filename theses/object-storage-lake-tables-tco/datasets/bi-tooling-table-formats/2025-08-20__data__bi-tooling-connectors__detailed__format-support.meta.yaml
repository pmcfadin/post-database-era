# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "90% - covers major connectors for primary tools"
  sample_size: "24 connector/format combinations across 7 tools"
  confidence: "high - based on official connector documentation"
  limitations: 
    - "Connector feature support changes with each release"
    - "Some connectors provide indirect access via underlying platforms"
    - "Performance characteristics not captured in this dataset"
    - "Configuration requirements vary by connector"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Tools access table formats primarily through database/platform connectors"
  - "Trino and Databricks connectors provide broadest format support"
  - "dbt adapters mirror underlying database capabilities"
  - "ELT tools increasingly offer direct format output capabilities"
  - "Snowflake and BigQuery connectors drive Iceberg adoption in BI tools"
  - "Delta Lake support concentrated in Microsoft/Databricks ecosystem"
  - "Hudi support remains limited across connector ecosystem"
  - "Write capabilities often require specific connector configurations"
