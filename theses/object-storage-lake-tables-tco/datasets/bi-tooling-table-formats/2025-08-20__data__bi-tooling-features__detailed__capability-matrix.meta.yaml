# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "85% - covers major tools and key feature categories"
  sample_size: "19 tool/feature combinations across 6 capability areas"
  confidence: "medium-high - based on technical documentation analysis"
  limitations: 
    - "Feature capabilities depend on specific configurations"
    - "Performance characteristics are workload-dependent"
    - "Some capabilities require specific versions or setups"
    - "Indirect access via connectors may limit feature availability"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Query pushdown shows strongest support across Iceberg and Delta formats"
  - "Time travel capabilities favor native format implementations"
  - "Schema evolution support varies significantly by tool architecture"
  - "Partition pruning effectiveness depends on metadata design"
  - "Performance optimizations are highly format-specific"
  - "Hudi shows limited advanced feature support across all categories"
  - "Analytics engines provide stronger feature support than BI/ELT tools"
  - "Feature parity improves when accessing via native platforms"
