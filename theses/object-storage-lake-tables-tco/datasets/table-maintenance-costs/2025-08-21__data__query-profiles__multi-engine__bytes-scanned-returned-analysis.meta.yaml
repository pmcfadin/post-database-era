# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "6 production query profiles"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Query patterns and data distributions vary significantly"
    - "Performance depends on cluster configuration and data layout"
    - "Results represent specific workload characteristics"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Read amplification shows efficiency of data scanning"
  - "Lower amplification ratios indicate better query optimization"
  - "Partition pruning effectiveness varies by query predicate selectivity"
  - "Spill to disk indicates memory pressure during execution"
  - "Network bytes may differ from returned bytes due to compression"
