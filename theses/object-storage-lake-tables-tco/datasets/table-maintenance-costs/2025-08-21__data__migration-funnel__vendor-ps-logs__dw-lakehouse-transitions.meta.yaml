# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all required fields populated"
  sample_size: "12 enterprise migrations"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Sample skewed toward larger enterprises (>1000 employees)"
    - "Vendor PS data may have selection bias toward complex migrations"
    - "Cost data includes only direct migration costs, not operational changes"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Data represents actual enterprise migrations tracked by vendor PS teams"
  - "Success rates calculated based on table-level migration completion"
  - "Duration includes planning, execution, and initial optimization phases"
  - "Blocker counts focus on major technical impediments requiring escalation"
  - "Cost data normalized to USD and includes external vendor fees"
