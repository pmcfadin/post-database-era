# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - major lineage platforms covered"
  sample_size: "10 lineage tracking platforms"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Accuracy percentages are estimates based on documented capabilities"
    - "Feature availability may depend on platform configuration"
    - "Cross-platform tracking capabilities vary by integration setup"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Unity Catalog leads in accuracy and real-time capabilities"
  - "Traditional data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift) have limited native lineage"
  - "Dedicated lineage platforms (DataHub, Collibra) offer strongest cross-platform support"
  - "Column-level tracking significantly improves governance capabilities"
  - "Real-time updates critical for operational data governance"
