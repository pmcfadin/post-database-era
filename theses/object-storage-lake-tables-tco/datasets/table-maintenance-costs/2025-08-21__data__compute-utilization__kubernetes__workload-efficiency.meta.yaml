# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "6 workload types x 4 cluster sizes"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Synthetic data based on Kubernetes best practices"
    - "Does not account for specific application optimizations"
    - "Node heterogeneity not modeled"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Larger clusters show lower utilization due to over-provisioning"
  - "Small clusters: ~35% CPU utilization, Large clusters: ~18%"
  - "Database primaries have different scaling patterns than replicas"
  - "Resource request/limit ratios indicate capacity planning efficiency"
