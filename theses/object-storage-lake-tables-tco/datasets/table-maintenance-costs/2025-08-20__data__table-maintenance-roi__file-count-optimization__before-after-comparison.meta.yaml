# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all comparison metrics calculated"
  sample_size: "3 optimization scenarios"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Based on performance modeling scenarios"
    - "ROI estimates use simplified assumptions"
    - "Actual improvements depend on query patterns"
    - "Cost models may vary by platform and region"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "File count reductions of 99.8% typical for heavily fragmented tables"
  - "Latency improvements range from 47% to 57%"
  - "Cost reductions more modest (9-15%) due to baseline storage costs"
  - "ROI typically achieved within 15 days of optimization"
  - "Results show consistent benefits across all table formats"
