# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "12 organizational case studies"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Data from public sources only, may not represent all cost structures"
    - "Different measurement periods across organizations"
    - "Cluster pricing varies by region and time"
    - "Some data points are estimates from presentations"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Costs normalized to standard USD pricing where possible"
  - "Includes data from major cloud providers and table format vendors"
  - "Job types cover full spectrum of table maintenance operations"
  - "Cluster types indicate the infrastructure used for cost context"
  - "Data spans both streaming and batch maintenance patterns"
