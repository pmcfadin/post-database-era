# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Database consolidation (cluster->serverless) shows highest cost reduction (35-65%)"
  - "Right-sizing clusters achieves 20-45% cost reduction with less risk"
  - "Hybrid deployments balance cost reduction with operational complexity"
  - "ROI typically achieved within 1-6 months"
  - "Utilization improvements range from 25-80% depending on scenario"
