# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Unity Catalog shows strongest cross-control enforcement"
  - "Traditional data warehouses have mature row/column security but limited lineage"
  - "Apache Ranger provides comprehensive policy management but requires external lineage tools"
  - "Data shows clear parity gaps between stack types"
  - "Compliance framework support varies significantly by platform"
