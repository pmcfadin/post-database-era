# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all incident types covered"
  sample_size: "Multiple organizations across 10 scenario types"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Prevention value estimates vary by organization size"
    - "MTTR depends on data size and complexity"
    - "Automation levels vary significantly across teams"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Pipeline failures are most common scenario (35% of incidents)"
  - "Security incidents have highest prevention value ($800K+ average)"
  - "Bad deploys have fastest recovery times (12-18 minutes MTTR)"
  - "All formats show >90% recovery success rates"
  - "Higher automation correlates with faster recovery times"
  - "Data loss risk significantly reduced with time travel capabilities"
  - "Compliance scenarios have highest prevention value per incident"
