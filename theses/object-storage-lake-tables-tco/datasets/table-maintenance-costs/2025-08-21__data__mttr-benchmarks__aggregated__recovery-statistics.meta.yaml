# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - complete statistical analysis"
  sample_size: "varies by technology stack (12-35 incidents)"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Sample sizes vary by technology maturity"
    - "Auto-recovery rates depend on configuration"
    - "Statistics may not represent all deployment scenarios"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Modern table formats (Iceberg, Delta, Hudi) show better MTTR than traditional databases"
  - "Auto-recovery rates highest for Delta Lake, lowest for traditional databases"
  - "Object storage accidental deletes have highest data loss probability"
  - "P95 MTTR shows significant variance in worst-case scenarios"
  - "Useful for SLA planning and technology selection decisions"
  - "Recovery rates reflect built-in resilience features of each technology"
