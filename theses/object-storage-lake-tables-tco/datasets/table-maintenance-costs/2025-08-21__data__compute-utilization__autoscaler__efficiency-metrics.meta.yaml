# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "4 autoscaler types x 8 samples each"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Synthetic data based on autoscaler behavior patterns"
    - "Workload-specific tuning not captured"
    - "Cold start penalties not fully modeled"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Serverless autoscalers have highest event frequency (50-500/day)"
  - "HPA and VPA show 70-95% scaling accuracy"
  - "Response times vary significantly: 10s (serverless) to 300s (cluster)"
  - "Cost savings range from 10-40% depending on workload pattern"
  - "False positive rates are inversely correlated with response time"
