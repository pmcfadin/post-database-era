# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - major policy engine types covered"
  sample_size: "14 engine-control combinations"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Centralized engines (OPA) offer universal coverage but high complexity"
  - "Native engines provide optimal performance within their ecosystems"
  - "Hybrid approaches (Unity Catalog) balance flexibility and performance"
  - "Traditional engines (Ranger) excel in Hadoop ecosystems but limited elsewhere"
  - "Data masking consistently shows highest implementation complexity"
