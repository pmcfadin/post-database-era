# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "8 performance studies"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Limited to published case studies and documentation"
    - "Metrics may vary significantly based on data characteristics"
    - "Query patterns and table sizes vary across studies"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Read amplification calculated as bytes_scanned / bytes_returned"
  - "Higher skipping rates indicate more effective data pruning"
  - "Results highly dependent on query selectivity and table layout"
  - "Production results may vary based on data distribution"
