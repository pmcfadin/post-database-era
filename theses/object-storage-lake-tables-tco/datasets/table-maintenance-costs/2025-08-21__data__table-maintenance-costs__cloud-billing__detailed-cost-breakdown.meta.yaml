# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "6 enterprise billing accounts across 3 cloud providers"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Billing data from public case studies only"
    - "Costs may vary by region and enterprise discount rates"
    - "Network costs depend on data locality and cross-region transfers"
    - "Storage I/O costs vary by access patterns and caching"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "All costs are actual billing charges, not list prices"
  - "Instance hours include both active job time and cluster startup/shutdown"
  - "Storage I/O includes both reads from source tables and writes for optimized outputs"
  - "Network costs primarily from data movement between storage and compute"
  - "Some organizations use reserved instances or committed use discounts"

  optimization_opportunities:
    - "Compute represents largest cost component - optimize instance sizing"
    - "Storage I/O costs can be reduced with better data locality"
    - "Network costs minimal but can be eliminated with same-region processing"
    - "BigQuery clustering shows best cost efficiency for supported workloads"
    - "Consider cloud-native optimization services over generic compute engines"
