# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "12 engine-workload combinations"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Costs may vary based on specific query patterns and optimizations"
    - "Some estimates based on typical resource consumption patterns"
    - "Regional pricing variations not captured"
    - "Storage costs not included, compute only"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "BigQuery uses pay-per-TB-processed model with consistent pricing"
  - "Snowflake costs depend on warehouse size and query complexity"
  - "Redshift costs based on instance hours, efficiency varies by workload"
  - "Open source engines (Trino, DuckDB) show significant cost advantages"
  - "Serverless options (BigQuery, Athena) have premium pricing for convenience"
  - "ETL workloads generally cost more per TB than BI due to resource intensity"
