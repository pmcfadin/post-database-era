# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "5 common entity types"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Quality scores are estimates based on typical implementations"
    - "Maintenance effort is subjective assessment"
    - "Consolidation ratios vary significantly by organization size"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Financial entities show highest quality scores due to regulatory requirements"
  - "Customer entities typically have highest consolidation complexity"
  - "Real-time sync patterns correlate with higher maintenance effort"
  - "Warehouse-authoritative strategies dominate critical business entities"
