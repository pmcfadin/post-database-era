  limitations:
    - "Derived metrics based on operational estimates"
    - "Sample size moderate for statistical analysis"
    - "Cross-industry variation in operational practices"
    - "Technology stack differences affect comparability"
    - "Time allocation ratios are estimated industry averages"
notes:
  - "Key metrics: fte_hours_per_tb and fte_hours_per_100_tables"
  - "Useful for operational planning and efficiency benchmarking"
  - "Data lake vs data warehouse patterns show different scaling characteristics"
  - "Cloud-native managed services show improved efficiency ratios"
  - "Financial services show higher maintenance ratios due to compliance"
  - "Derived metrics provide actionable operational insights"
