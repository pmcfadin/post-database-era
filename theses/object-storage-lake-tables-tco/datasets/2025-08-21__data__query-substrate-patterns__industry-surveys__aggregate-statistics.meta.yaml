# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all surveys include both native and external percentages"
  sample_size: "4,529 total organizations across all surveys (excluding case studies)"
  confidence: "high - based on direct vendor data and published research"
  limitations: 
    - "Survey definitions of 'native' vs 'external' may vary across vendors"
    - "Self-reported data with potential bias toward early adopters"
    - "Temporal variation - surveys conducted over 9-month period"
    - "Case studies (Netflix, Airbnb) represent single organization patterns"
    - "Academic benchmarks may not reflect production workload patterns"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Weighted average across all surveys: 54.7% native, 45.3% external/lake queries"
  - "Strong variation by platform type - federated engines heavily external-focused"
  - "Traditional cloud data warehouses maintain higher native storage usage"
  - "Lakehouse platforms show more balanced distribution"
  - "Data reflects publicly disclosed survey results, not proprietary query logs"
  - "Useful for understanding industry-wide adoption trends and platform positioning"
  
# Key Findings
key_findings:
  overall_trend: "Industry moving toward more balanced query distribution between native and external storage"
  platform_differences: "Federated engines (Trino, Presto) heavily external-focused (80%+), traditional warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake) remain native-heavy (75%+)"
  enterprise_adoption: "Enterprise platforms average 71.4% native queries, suggesting gradual migration approach"
  case_study_insights: "High-scale tech companies (Netflix, Airbnb) show external-heavy patterns post-migration"
