# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - synthetic dataset based on documented billing patterns"
  sample_size: "5 account types across 4 platforms over 18 months"
  confidence: "medium - based on documented billing patterns and cost optimization guides"
  limitations: 
    - "Synthetic data based on billing documentation, not actual customer bills"
    - "Cost estimates based on published pricing, actual costs may vary"
    - "Query volume estimates derived from spend patterns, not actual logs"
    - "Does not include private or custom pricing agreements"
    - "Billing models simplified compared to actual cloud pricing complexity"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Useful for understanding cost implications of substrate choices"
  - "Shows relationship between account tiers and substrate adoption patterns"
  - "External storage formats generally show lower per-query costs due to storage separation"
  - "Committed accounts tend to favor native storage for predictable costs"
  - "Startup accounts with credits show higher external format usage"
  - "Data reflects general billing patterns, not specific customer agreements"
  
# Billing Context
billing_insights:
  cost_drivers: "Query volume and data processed are primary cost factors across all platforms"
  native_vs_external: "Native storage often has higher per-TB costs but lower egress charges"
  platform_differences: "Athena purely external-focused, BigQuery/Snowflake native-heavy, Databricks balanced"
  account_tier_impact: "Enterprise committed accounts show 70%+ native usage, startups with credits favor external (60%+)"
  growth_patterns: "External format usage growing 3% monthly across all account types"
