# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated with real-world data"
  sample_size: "17 production deployments and benchmark results"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Costs reflect specific time periods and may not include latest pricing"
    - "Configuration differences impact cost comparisons"
    - "Some estimates derived from partial public information"
    - "Regional and volume discount variations not captured"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "TPC benchmark data provides standardized comparison baseline"
  - "Customer case studies reflect real production workload patterns"
  - "Open source engines show 4-5x cost advantage over cloud managed services"
  - "Workload type significantly impacts cost efficiency"
  - "Data format and compression greatly affect effective cost per TB"
  - "Large-scale deployments (Netflix, Uber) achieve better cost efficiency"
  - "Emerging Rust-based engines (Polars, DataFusion) show exceptional efficiency"
  - "Cloud managed services trade cost for operational simplicity"
