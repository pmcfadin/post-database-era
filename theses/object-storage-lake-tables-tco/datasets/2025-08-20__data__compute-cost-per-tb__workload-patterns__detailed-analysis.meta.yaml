# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated with production data"
  sample_size: "15 production workload patterns"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Resource utilization estimates based on typical configurations"
    - "Optimization benefits may vary by data characteristics"
    - "Some serverless platforms don't expose resource metrics"
    - "Cross-engine comparisons affected by architecture differences"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "ETL workloads average 40% higher cost/TB than BI due to complexity"
  - "Ad-hoc queries most cost-efficient due to selective processing"
  - "Optimization can reduce costs by 40-60% (Spark example: $3.00 â†’ $1.20/TB)"
  - "Partitioning and format choice critical for cost optimization"
  - "Cloud managed services trade cost for operational simplicity"
  - "Resource utilization varies significantly by workload complexity"
  - "Scale effects: larger workloads often achieve better cost efficiency"
  - "Caching and pre-aggregation provide substantial cost benefits for BI workloads"
