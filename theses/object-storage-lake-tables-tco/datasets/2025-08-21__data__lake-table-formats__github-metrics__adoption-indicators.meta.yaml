# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "6 major repositories"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "GitHub metrics are proxies, not direct adoption measures"
    - "Enterprise usage may not correlate with GitHub activity"
    - "Some projects have multiple repositories"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Delta Lake shows highest GitHub engagement"
  - "Iceberg has strong corporate backing (Apache Foundation)"
  - "Hudi is oldest but shows lower recent activity"
  - "Python and Rust implementations indicate language diversity"
  - "Adoption indicator score uses weighted formula of engagement metrics"
