# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "9 representative architectural patterns"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Based on publicly available survey data and architectural patterns"
    - "Sample focused on modern data stack and enterprise patterns"
    - "Transformation delay times are estimates based on typical implementations"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Object storage first (ELT) patterns dominate modern implementations (67%)"
  - "Traditional ETL patterns still common in large enterprises with existing infrastructure"
  - "Streaming patterns show lowest transformation delays but represent smaller data volumes"
  - "Hybrid patterns emerging as compromise between flexibility and performance"
  - "Real-time percentage varies significantly by use case and industry"
