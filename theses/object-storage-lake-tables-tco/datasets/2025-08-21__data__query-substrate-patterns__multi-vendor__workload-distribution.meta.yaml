# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - synthetic dataset based on documented patterns"
  sample_size: "6 organizations across 6 platforms over 21 months"
  confidence: "medium - based on aggregated industry reports and case studies"
  limitations: 
    - "Synthesized data based on publicly available patterns, not raw query logs"
    - "Account patterns generalized from industry case studies"
    - "Exact query volumes estimated from conference presentations"
    - "Does not include proprietary query engines or custom solutions"
    - "Bias toward well-documented enterprise use cases"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Dataset represents industry-wide patterns rather than specific customer data"
  - "Table type classifications aligned with vendor documentation and open standards"
  - "Time series shows general adoption trends observed across multiple sources"
  - "Useful for understanding relative query distribution patterns by substrate type"
  - "Should be validated against actual query logs for specific use cases"
  - "Data reflects publicly shared metrics from vendor conferences and published studies"
