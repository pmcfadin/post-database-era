# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for core metrics, 67% for optimization data"
  sample_size: "23 organizations across 10 industry verticals"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Modeled data based on industry patterns, not direct measurements"
    - "Cost models simplified - actual TCO includes many additional factors"
    - "Workload mix percentages represent steady-state averages"
    - "Does not account for seasonal workload variations"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Enterprise cases represent typical industry workload patterns"
  - "Sensitivity analysis explores TCO impact of different workload compositions"
  - "Cost factors: BI baseline (1.0x), ETL efficient (0.7x), ML intensive (1.8x)"
  - "Optimization scenarios show 18-25% cost reduction potential"
  - "Data useful for TCO modeling and workload portfolio optimization"
  - "Cost per TB varies significantly by industry and optimization level"
