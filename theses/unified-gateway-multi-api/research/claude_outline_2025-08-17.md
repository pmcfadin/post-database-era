# Research Questions: Unified Gateway Multi-API Convergence

**Thesis**: Managed platforms will expose SQL, KV, Doc, Graph, Search via a unified gateway, driven by developer velocity and cost, measurable by growth in multi-API SKUs by 2030.

## Sub-Theme 1: Unified Gateway Adoption by Managed Platforms

**Confirmatory Questions:**
- Do top 10 cloud database services offer unified API gateways as of 2025?
- Are Azure Cosmos DB, AWS DocumentDB, GCP Firestore expanding multi-API support?
- Do new managed database launches default to multi-API architectures?
- Are gateway patterns (Stargate, DataStax) being adopted by major vendors?

**Falsifying Questions:**
- Do vendors prioritize engine-specific optimization over unified interfaces?
- Are performance penalties >20% when using unified vs native APIs?
- Do enterprise customers prefer dedicated endpoints over unified gateways?
- Are security/compliance teams blocking unified gateway deployments?

## Sub-Theme 2: Multi-API Integration (SQL, KV, Document, Graph, Search)

**Confirmatory Questions:**
- Do Redis-compatible APIs work across multiple managed platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
- Can SQL queries execute against document stores in production environments?
- Are graph traversals (GQL/Gremlin) available through same endpoint as SQL?
- Do search APIs (OpenSearch/Elastic) integrate with SQL interfaces?
- Are JSONPath expressions standardized across SQL and document APIs?

**Falsifying Questions:**
- Do API inconsistencies force teams to use engine-specific interfaces?
- Are graph query languages fragmented across platforms (GQL vs Gremlin vs Cypher)?
- Do search features require separate specialized engines in practice?
- Are SQL dialect differences blocking cross-platform compatibility?
- Do KV operations fail when routed through SQL gateways?

## Sub-Theme 3: Developer Velocity as Primary Driver

**Confirmatory Questions:**
- Do surveys show >60% of teams cite dev speed as reason for multi-API adoption?
- Are onboarding times faster with unified vs specialized database APIs?
- Do job postings emphasize API patterns over specific database engines?
- Are bootcamps/training focusing on standard interfaces vs vendor syntax?
- Do developer productivity metrics improve with gateway consolidation?

**Falsifying Questions:**
- Do teams report slower development due to abstraction layer complexity?
- Are debugging challenges increased with unified gateway architectures?
- Do developers prefer engine-specific tooling over generic interfaces?
- Are learning curves steeper for multi-API systems vs specialized tools?
- Do performance optimization require engine-specific knowledge anyway?

## Sub-Theme 4: Cost Optimization as Primary Driver

**Confirmatory Questions:**
- Do unified platforms reduce infrastructure costs vs polyglot persistence?
- Are multi-API SKUs priced competitively vs separate specialized services?
- Do teams report lower operational overhead with gateway consolidation?
- Are licensing costs reduced through platform consolidation?
- Do cloud bills decrease when migrating from multiple DBs to unified platforms?

**Falsifying Questions:**
- Do unified platforms have price premiums vs specialized alternatives?
- Are operational costs higher due to increased complexity?
- Do performance inefficiencies increase compute costs >15%?
- Are vendor lock-in costs higher with unified platforms?
- Do teams need specialized expertise increasing personnel costs?

## Sub-Theme 5: Market Growth in Multi-API SKUs

**Confirmatory Questions:**
- Are >50% of new database SKUs multi-API by cloud vendors 2024-2025?
- Do multi-API offerings show >25% YoY revenue growth vs single-purpose?
- Are venture investments favoring multi-API database startups?
- Do analyst reports show increased multi-API platform adoption?
- Are RFPs specifying multi-API requirements vs single-purpose engines?

**Falsifying Questions:**
- Do specialized database revenues continue outgrowing multi-API platforms?
- Are single-purpose acquisitions (vector DBs, time-series) accelerating?
- Do enterprises standardize on specialized best-of-breed vs unified?
- Are new data modalities (spatial, quantum) requiring specialized engines?
- Do performance-critical applications avoid multi-API platforms?

## Sub-Theme 6: Timeline Feasibility (Achievement by 2030)

**Confirmatory Questions:**
- Are current multi-API platforms production-ready for enterprise workloads?
- Do technology roadmaps from major vendors target 2028-2030 for full API coverage?
- Are standards bodies (ISO GQL, SQL:2023, JSONPath) on track for broad adoption?
- Do current performance gaps appear solvable within 5-year timeframe?
- Are migration tools mature enough to enable 2030 transitions?

**Falsifying Questions:**
- Do fundamental architectural limitations prevent unified gateway scaling?
- Are standardization efforts stalled or fragmented across vendors?
- Do security/compliance requirements extend migration timelines beyond 2030?
- Are legacy system dependencies blocking unified gateway adoption?
- Do new data types/workloads emerge requiring specialized engines post-2030?

## Critical Counterevidence Areas

**Technical Limitations:**
- Performance penalties that make unified gateways impractical
- API complexity that reduces rather than improves developer productivity
- Security vulnerabilities introduced by gateway abstraction layers

**Market Dynamics:**
- Vendor incentives to maintain differentiation through proprietary APIs
- Enterprise resistance to unified platforms due to risk concentration
- Continued innovation in specialized engines outpacing unified alternatives

**Adoption Barriers:**
- Skills gap preventing teams from adopting multi-API architectures
- Regulatory/compliance requirements favoring specialized solutions
- Economic conditions reducing willingness to invest in platform migrations
