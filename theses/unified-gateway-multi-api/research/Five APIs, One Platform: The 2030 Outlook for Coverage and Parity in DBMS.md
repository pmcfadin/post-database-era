Five APIs, One Platform: The 2030 Outlook for Coverage and Parity in DBMS

Executive Summary

This report examines the state of multi-model database API coverage and feature parity across five major data models – relational (SQL), key–value, document, graph, and search – and projects trends toward the year 2030. We find that leading database vendors are increasingly offering multi-model capabilities under one product or service, though not all achieve full parity or integration across APIs yet. By 2030, it is anticipated that multi-model databases will be more common, with closer feature parity and stronger cross-API consistency, but significant counterpoints remain (e.g. performance trade-offs and the persistence of specialized “purpose-built” databases).

Multi-Model Offerings: Several vendors already support multiple APIs within a single platform. For example, Azure Cosmos DB supports five APIs – a SQL-like document store, MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column key-value), Gremlin (graph), and Table (key–value) – all backed by the same globally distributed engine ￼ ￼. Traditional RDBMS vendors (Oracle, IBM, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP HANA, etc.) have also evolved into “converged” or multi-model databases by adding native JSON document storage, graph querying, and full-text search to their relational engines ￼ ￼. Open-source multi-model databases such as ArangoDB and OrientDB were designed from the ground up to support multiple models with a unified backend, combining document, graph, and key–value data under one query interface ￼. By 2030, we expect most leading DBMS platforms to offer multi-model capabilities under a unified service name or cloud endpoint, reflecting industry demand for flexible data modeling.

Feature Parity and Gaps: However, supporting five APIs does not automatically mean full feature parity across them. Today, feature gaps persist – often the “core” or original API of a service is more feature-rich than the others. For instance, in Azure Cosmos DB the native SQL (NoSQL JSON) API supports the most extensive features (JavaScript stored procedures, user-defined functions, analytical workloads via Synapse Link, etc.), whereas other APIs can lag. Microsoft explicitly notes that “any new feature…is first available on [the] API for NoSQL”, with MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, etc. following later ￼. This leads to scenarios where a capability is GA (generally available) in one API but in preview or absent in others. As of mid-2020s, Cosmos’s Gremlin (graph) API, for example, lacked support for multi-item transactions and some analytics that the SQL API had, and the MongoDB API in Cosmos only recently gained limited multi-document transaction support (within a single partition) ￼ ￼. Similarly, multi-model platforms that retrofitted new models (e.g. SQL databases adding JSON) may not offer the full depth of features compared to a purpose-built system – e.g. some RDBMS support JSON storage but are “poorly optimized for JSON queries” relative to native document databases ￼ ￼. By 2030, the goal is to drive these parity gaps below 10% for core operations (CRUD, indexing, queries, pagination) across all API endpoints. In practice, we project that parity will improve (as vendors continue to fill gaps in secondary APIs), but some differences will remain. Certain advanced features might still debut on one model first or have constraints when used via another model’s interface. A positive trend is that some multi-model systems use a single query language across models (e.g. ArangoDB’s AQL for documents, graphs, and search), inherently giving parity – users can “combine graph traversal, document retrieval, and full-text search within a single query” ￼. Where separate APIs are used, vendors are expected to minimize any functional delta between them, aiming for >90% feature coverage alignment by the end of the decade.

Cross-API Consistency: A key promise of unified multi-model databases is data consistency across different API accesses, which polyglot systems historically struggle with. In true multi-model engines (single backend), all APIs operate on the same data store, so reads and writes via different interfaces observe the same underlying state with ACID guarantees. For example, Azure Cosmos DB uses an Atom-Record-Sequence (ARS) storage engine that underpins all its APIs, ensuring that “all the supported APIs are projections of the ARS model” ￼. This means a write through the MongoDB API or Cassandra API is persisted in the same replicated data as a SQL API write, abiding by Cosmos’s globally-distributed consistency levels across the board. Documentation confirms that Cosmos’s consistency configuration (from strong to eventual) applies equally to all APIs – e.g. a “read your own write” session guarantee holds whether you use MongoDB or SQL API to read, as long as you use the same session token. Likewise, MarkLogic (a multi-model DB for documents, RDF graph, etc.) provides “a unified … interface” to all data models and “data consistency” with ACID transactions spanning JSON, XML, and triples ￼. In practice, vendors have largely achieved consistency parity within a single multi-model product – there have been no reports of inconsistency when using different APIs on the same underlying data, because typically one must choose an API at container/database creation time (ensuring a single engine is in play). The caveat is that in systems where each API is actually backed by a different engine or segregated data (e.g. if a cloud vendor offers separate services under one umbrella name), then cross-API consistency is not automatic. For example, Azure Cosmos DB’s new PostgreSQL API is essentially a separate PostgreSQL cluster (for relational workloads) and does not share data with, say, the Cassandra API accounts – thus consistency is only within each API’s context. But when a single engine supports multiple models, the consistency semantics documented (e.g. atomicity, isolation levels) generally hold uniformly. By 2030, cross-API consistency is expected to remain strong in truly unified platforms – vendors will highlight that using multiple data models no longer requires developers to write complex synchronization logic. This aligns with the selling point that multi-model databases “facilitate integrated data…for data consistency, security, and access” in one system ￼. In contrast, the alternative (polyglot with separate DBs) still suffers from consistency lags or complex integrations, which is a key driver pushing users to multi-model solutions ￼.

Disparity in API Maturity: As noted, new features often roll out unevenly. We investigated how often a feature is GA in one API but preview or missing in others. In Cosmos DB’s history, this has been common – for example, server-side programming (stored procedures/triggers) exists in the SQL API (formerly DocumentDB) since launch, but is not supported in the MongoDB API or Gremlin API (no JavaScript SPs) as of 2025. Analytical indexing (Cosmos’s Synapse Link for near-real-time analytics) initially launched only for the SQL API, with Cassandra and Mongo APIs receiving it later. Microsoft’s guidance to customers migrating to Cosmos is to “evaluate the feature support of these APIs” beforehand ￼, acknowledging that some capabilities (like certain index types, cross-partition queries, etc.) might be limited for non-core APIs. Outside Cosmos, we see similar timing gaps: ArangoDB introduced full-text search (ArangoSearch) and made it immediately available through its unified AQL queries for any model, whereas Couchbase (a multi-model JSON + key-value DB) added a full-text search service that initially had separate interfaces and was not as integrated as its N1QL query for JSON ￼. Neptune (AWS’s graph DB) and DocumentDB (AWS’s Mongo API service) are separate products, so AWS’s model is to release features per engine independently – one might gain functionality while another lags, but since they are not under one product name, this is slightly outside the scope of a single product parity. By 2030, if vendors continue to unify APIs under one service, we expect them to also tighten the release gap, perhaps adopting a policy that new enhancements must reach all API endpoints within a certain timeframe (months). Ideally, parity gaps for fundamental operations (CRUD, indexing, paging) will shrink to <10% difference in capability. Nonetheless, some discrepancies may persist in edge functionality – e.g. a graph traversal API might never support complex SQL-style JOINs, and a document API might not support all graph algorithms. The current evidence suggests that even today’s flagship multi-model DB (Cosmos) still has “basic relational limitations” (no JOINs in its SQL API) and requires separate containers per model ￼ ￼. Thus, achieving near-perfect parity is an ongoing challenge.

Migration Tools and API Shims: A major advantage of offering multiple APIs is easing migration and integration. Do vendors maintain migration guides or “API shim” layers for all five APIs? In Cosmos DB’s case, yes – Microsoft provides detailed guides for users familiar with MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, or Table to adapt to Cosmos’s implementations ￼ ￼. Cosmos’s APIs for MongoDB, Cassandra, and Gremlin are explicitly wire-protocol compatible shims for those databases ￼ ￼. This means a developer can take an existing MongoDB application and point it at Cosmos by simply changing the connection string in many cases ￼. The API behavior isn’t 100% identical (as noted, some MongoDB commands or aggregation stages may not be supported by Cosmos), but the intent is to minimize code changes. These shims must be continually updated – e.g. Cosmos now supports MongoDB API version 4.2, after previously supporting 3.6, to allow features like multi-document transactions (with restrictions) ￼. Notably, MongoDB Inc.’s tests found Cosmos’s Mongo API failed about 67% of their compatibility test cases (as of 2023), meaning the shim covers only ~33% of Mongo’s features ￼. This underscores that maintaining a complete, up-to-date shim is non-trivial. Outside Cosmos, other vendors also offer compatibility layers: e.g. DataStax’s Stargate proxy provides a Cassandra-backed service with REST, GraphQL, and document API endpoints for the same data ￼, letting developers use different paradigms on a Cassandra cluster. These are essentially API shims (GraphQL to CQL, JSON document to CQL, etc.). By 2030, we expect vendors who claim full multi-model support will also provide robust migration tools for each model, helping users port data and queries. This includes maintaining documentation for each API (“If you use X feature in MongoDB, here’s how to do it or its status in our service”) and possibly automated shims or adapters. It is likely that multi-model cloud services will continue implementing popular APIs (for example, a SQL RDBMS API, like PostgreSQL, as Cosmos has done, or a full-text search API compatibility mode). The challenge will be keeping up with the source ecosystems’ evolution; vendors might focus on the most used 80–90% of features to maintain <10% “missing” features as per parity goals.

Unified SDKs and Pluggable API Modes: An ideal developer experience would allow using different data models through a single client library or SDK, perhaps by toggling modes or endpoints. Today, the reality is usually separate client SDKs per API. In Cosmos DB, for instance, one must use the native Cosmos SDK for SQL API, a MongoDB driver for Mongo API, a Cassandra driver for Cassandra API, etc. – there is no single Cosmos SDK that abstracts all APIs. In fact, Cosmos accounts are bound to one API at creation, so a unified client doesn’t apply (one can’t query the same account with both Mongo and SQL SDKs at the same time) ￼ ￼. By 2030, if interoperability increases (e.g. Cosmos has hinted at eventually allowing switching APIs on the same data ￼), there may be more unified SDK experiences. Some multi-model databases already offer a unified query interface: ArangoDB’s drivers, for example, send AQL queries that can perform document, graph, and search operations together – from the application’s perspective, it’s one client connection doing everything. Similarly, MarkLogic exposes a REST API (and Java/Python/etc. bindings) where a single query can include search, document and triple queries; its Optic API even allows joining graphs and documents in one call. These unified clients simplify development: the ArangoDB documentation highlights that “users can easily change their data access strategy by just changing a query,” not the database or driver ￼. We anticipate more vendors moving in this direction – possibly providing a polymorphic SDK that can, say, execute a Gremlin query or a SQL query depending on context, without switching libraries. Microsoft could, for instance, create an Azure Cosmos Unified Client that takes a parameter for which API or query dialect to use, although this might internally just wrap different drivers. The motivation is strong: a unified SDK could enable polyglot data access in the same app more seamlessly. However, the technical complexity (different wire protocols, query languages) is a barrier. Another angle is cloud-native data API services (like Azure’s Data API Builder or AWS AppSync) that can unify access: these provide a single GraphQL endpoint to fetch from multiple underlying models. While not exactly an SDK, they point to a trend of abstracting the database interfaces into one cohesive layer. By 2030, unified and pluggable API clients may become more common, especially for multi-model cloud offerings, improving developer productivity by treating disparate data APIs as interchangeable modules. This will likely coincide with more unified query planners under the hood, so that a mixed-model query can be optimized across data models.

Trends and Outlook to 2030: All signs indicate that the multi-model database approach will grow in prominence through 2030. The push towards flexible, AI-driven and analytics-heavy applications favors databases that can handle diverse data in one place. Gartner’s 2020 analysis already defined multi-model DBMS as those supporting various data formats in one engine ￼, and by 2025–2030 we expect that definition to expand (as noted by analysts) to include full-text search and even ML/Vector data as first-class models ￼ ￼. We are seeing convergence in traditionally separate products: Oracle 23c (released in beta 2022) integrates JSON and graph directly into the relational engine, introducing SQL queries over JSON (duality views) and property graph queries on relational tables ￼ ￼ – a clear sign that even entrenched RDBMS are moving toward one unified multi-model platform. Cloud vendors are split: Microsoft Azure has bet on a single multi-model service (Cosmos DB) for operational data, and is likely to continue expanding its API portfolio (perhaps adding an integrated search API by 2030, or deeper integration with OpenAI/Vector indexes given trends). Google Cloud thus far has distinct services (Bigtable, Firestore, etc.), but could introduce a unifying layer as the market matures. AWS, on the other hand, has famously advocated purpose-built databases for each data model ￼ ￼ – offering over 15 different databases (Aurora for SQL, DynamoDB for key-value, DocumentDB for Mongo API, Neptune for graph, OpenSearch for text, etc.). Through 2030, AWS is likely to maintain that polyglot strategy, though they may provide better integration tools (e.g. data lake and federated query services) to give a facade of unification. The trade-off between one-size-fits-all versus specialized engines will persist. Performance-sensitive or very large scale use-cases often still choose specialized databases (a graph DB optimized for graph traversals, a search engine optimized for text indexing, etc.). However, for a huge number of general-purpose applications, the convenience of multi-model databases – fewer moving parts, unified security and consistency, one provisioning model – is highly attractive ￼ ￼. We predict that by 2030, many enterprises will adopt multi-model cloud databases for new projects, expecting them to support at least the “big five” APIs with near-parity. Feature parity gaps will shrink as these systems mature, though some niche features might still lag. Cross-API consistency will continue to be a selling point (e.g. “no more eventual-consistency delays between separate DBs – our one DB does it all with ACID”). Additionally, multi-model SDKs and query languages might emerge, allowing more fluid development across data models. A noteworthy emerging area is vector search/AI integration – arguably a new “model” (embedding vectors for similarity search) that multi-model databases are beginning to incorporate. For example, Redis added a vector index module, and ArangoDB has introduced vector search alongside its other models ￼. By 2030, vector and time-series data may be considered additional APIs that unified databases cover, further broadening the concept of multi-model.

Counter-Evidence and Challenges: Despite the optimistic trend, there are clear counterpoints and challenges to note:
	•	“One Size Fits All” Concerns: The AWS perspective, articulated by its CTO Werner Vogels, holds that “the days of the one-size-fits-all monolithic database are behind us” ￼. Specialized (“purpose-built”) databases often outperform multi-model engines for specific workloads. For example, a pure search engine (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) may always offer more powerful text querying than a general multi-model DB that “also includes search.” Some vendors and users will continue to prefer a constellation of specialized services fine-tuned for each data model, especially at extreme scale or for unique features. Performance and optimization trade-offs are a major factor – a multi-model engine may be forced to make design compromises. The ChaosSearch analysis notes that many so-called multi-model solutions “fall short… in delivering high-performance searching/querying” across all models ￼ ￼. For instance, a multi-model DB might handle document and key-value queries well but execute graph traversals slower than a dedicated graph DB, or vice versa. These realities mean that even by 2030, we likely won’t see complete convergence where one engine is best at everything. Some complex use-cases (e.g. heavy graph analytics combined with full-text search on massive data) might still benefit from integrating separate systems rather than relying on one engine to do it all.
	•	Current Limitations in “Unified” Products: Even the flagship multi-model offerings reveal limitations that serve as counter-evidence to total API parity. As detailed, Cosmos DB – while supporting five APIs – requires users to pick one API per database instance, effectively siloing data by model ￼ ￼. You cannot issue a Gremlin traversal and a SQL query on the same container in Cosmos; you’d need to duplicate data into two containers if you truly needed both interfaces, defeating the single-source-of-truth ideal ￼ ￼. This shows that full multi-model interoperability (one dataset, queryable by any API at any time) isn’t yet reality in some systems. Additionally, Cosmos still lacks a native full-text search API – users must integrate with Azure Cognitive Search for text queries, meaning “search” is not on equal footing with its other APIs ￼. These gaps highlight that as of 2025, no single product cleanly delivers all five models at equivalent capability. OrientDB, another multi-model DB, supports graphs and docs, but requires different indexing approaches for each and may require reindexing data for certain queries ￼. Such complexity can reduce the purported ease of multi-model systems. The ChaosSearch report bluntly states: “none… fully support all data models [with] high-performance querying… it’s time for a true multi-model database” ￼. This skepticism implies that current solutions haven’t completely lived up to the promise, which means there is risk that some multi-model claims remain partly “hype” by 2030 as well.
	•	Vendor Lock-in and Ecosystem: A multi-model DB that exposes popular APIs (SQL, Mongo, etc.) aims to avoid lock-in, but subtle differences (like Cosmos’s Mongo API compatibility at only ~32% of MongoDB’s features ￼) can trap users in that environment with less-than-full functionality. Meanwhile, the actual MongoDB or Neo4j (graph) communities innovate rapidly – keeping up within one unified product is challenging. If vendors fail to keep pace on each API, users might prefer the dedicated databases from the open-source/vendor that leads that model. For example, if Cosmos’s Gremlin API stagnates (no new TinkerPop features) while native Apache TinkerPop evolves, graph developers may avoid the multi-model offering. Thus, maintaining five APIs at parity is costly and complex for vendors, which could slow progress or result in some APIs always lagging. By 2030, it’s possible some vendors will deprecate or drop under-used APIs. (We’ve seen DataStax shift away from their graph API in favor of integration with JanusGraph, for instance, when their multi-model DSE platform saw limited uptake for graph.)
	•	Use-case Segmentation: Not every application needs all five models. The existence of multi-model DBs doesn’t eliminate the fact that many workloads are sufficiently served by a single-model database. Developers might choose a simpler, specialized store if they don’t truly require multiple access patterns. The continued popularity of purpose-built databases suggests that multi-model databases will complement, not fully replace, single-model databases by 2030. For critical applications, organizations might still use polyglot persistence – e.g. an event tracking system might use a time-series DB + search engine in tandem, rather than relying on one multi-model DB to do both, especially if that one DB can’t match the scale or features of the dedicated solutions. Polyglot strategies do introduce “operational complexity” and “lack of consistency” ￼, but tools and patterns (like Change Data Capture, data lakes, etc.) are evolving to mitigate these, which is a competing trend to watch.

In summary, by 2030 most leading database vendors are expected to offer unified multi-model databases supporting SQL, key–value, document, graph, and search APIs within one platform, motivated by the benefits of developer agility and integrated data management. Those platforms will likely achieve much closer feature parity across APIs (aiming for >90% parity in CRUD and query capabilities), and they will uphold consistent cross-API read/write semantics as a core feature (a strong point over polyglot setups). Migration support for popular data models will be robust, lowering barriers for users to consolidate onto multi-model systems. We also anticipate improvements in the unification of client interfaces and query languages, simplifying multi-model development. However, it is equally clear that one-size-fits-all solutions face ongoing challenges. Certain data models or use-cases will continue to demand specialized systems for performance or functionality reasons, and vendors must balance breadth of model support with depth of features. The counter-evidence suggests that no current solution perfectly balances all five models at scale – a reality that may persist into 2030. Some organizations will therefore continue a hybrid approach: leveraging multi-model databases for moderate workloads and rapid development, while employing specialty databases where absolute performance or full feature-set of a model is paramount.

Ultimately, the trend is toward greater convergence of data models under unified platforms – a reversal of the early 2010s explosion of niche databases – but with a nuanced outcome where multi-model databases become highly capable generalists for the majority of applications, and purpose-built databases remain in play for the extremes. The successful multi-model DBMS of 2030 will be the ones that most effectively deliver on interoperability and parity without compromising the strengths of each model, thereby fulfilling the promise of a “true” multi-model database that industry visionaries have outlined ￼ ￼.
