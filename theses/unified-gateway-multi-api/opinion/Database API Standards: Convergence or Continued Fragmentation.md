The sources present differing perspectives on the degree and timeline of standards convergence in database APIs.

**Side 1: Standards are converging, enabling unified platforms by 2030.**

This perspective highlights significant progress in standardizing data models and query languages, which is seen as laying a clear technical foundation for unified multi-API data platforms. Key developments include the publication of the **ISO Graph Query Language (GQL) standard in April 2024**, marking the first new ISO database language since SQL in 1987. Additionally, the **SQL:2023 standard, adopted in 2023, now incorporates property-graph queries and enhanced JSON support**, bridging relational and non-relational capabilities within SQL. JSONPath also became an IETF standard in February 2024, standardizing JSON querying. Vendors are actively involved in these efforts and are aligning their roadmaps to implement these standards, aiming for "full API coverage" within their products by 2028-2030. This broad community consensus and technical progress suggest that unified data access is increasingly achievable.

*   " Importantly, performance and scalability gaps, often cited as challenges to “one engine for everything,” appear surmountable on this timeframe. Research prototypes have shown that with proper engineering, relational systems can efficiently handle graph and other non-relational workloads. For example, integrating property-graph queries into a relational engine (as in DuckDB’s “DuckPGQ” project) yielded “encouraging performance and scalability on large graph datasets,” albeit with further optimizations (e.g. worst-case optimal joins) still being studied ￼ ￼."
*   " First, the advancement of standards gives a proxy for vendor intentions, since major database companies typically drive and follow standards for core features. The SQL standard itself has evolved to encompass more models. Notably, SQL:2023 (the most recent SQL standard, finalized in 2023) includes a brand-new Part 16 for Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) ￼ ￼. This extension lets SQL query graph-structured data (nodes and edges stored in tables) using pattern matching semantics, effectively bridging the gap between relational and graph database capabilities. In parallel, an ISO project to create a separate standard graph query language – ISO GQL – was launched in 2019 and reached fruition in 2024. ISO GQL (Graph Query Language) was published as an international standard in April 2024, representing the first new ISO database query language since SQL in the 1980s ￼."
*   " In summary, the roadmap evidence suggests that 2030 is a realistic target for having platforms that cover essentially all common data APIs. The presence of ISO GQL and SQL/PGQ in 2023–24 means vendors have what they need (spec-wise) to implement graph queries in both relational and native graph databases within a few years. The JSONPath standard provides uniformity for document queries. And vendors like Microsoft and Oracle are clearly positioning their flagship data platforms to be “all-in-one” by the end of the decade. This convergence bodes well for achieving a unified gateway on the 2030 timeline, as it’s not just one company’s ambition but rather an industry-wide direction."

**Side 2: Fragmentation in standards and implementation will persist beyond 2030.**

This perspective cautions that even with new standards, **true, universal unification by 2030 may be challenging** due to fragmentation in vendor implementations and the existence of multiple, competing standards. While ISO GQL is published, it's version 1.0 and may lack features that vendors currently offer as proprietary extensions, meaning **"GQL" might not be identical across platforms** in the short term. Vendors might prioritize their own dialects or lag in adopting new standards, perpetuating fragmentation. Additionally, **SQL/PGQ, while part of SQL:2023, might not be uniformly implemented across all relational databases** by 2030, and some graph database vendors might only support ISO GQL, creating dual paths. Other popular query paradigms like GraphQL and SPARQL for RDF graphs are distinct from GQL/SQL and may not unify. This suggests that users might still need to manage multiple "unified" APIs or proprietary extensions, complicating the promise of a single gateway.

*   " A current example is the state of graph query languages. Yes, ISO GQL is now an official standard, but as of 2025 it is version 1.0 and not yet implemented fully anywhere (to our knowledge). Graph database vendors like Neo4j and TigerGraph each have their own languages (Cypher, GSQL, etc.), and while they participated in GQL development and intend to support it, it may take time to appear in production releases. During that interim, each vendor might continue pushing their dialect with extensions. The AWS/Neo4j joint announcement on GQL in 2024 reassured users that “current Cypher will remain supported” and that differences will be bridged gradually – e.g. adding support for new GQL keywords alongside existing ones ￼ ￼. They explicitly noted that some Cypher features didn’t make it into GQL v1 (such as the MERGE command, certain data import syntax, etc.), and these will remain vendor-specific extensions until a future GQL standard revision can include them ￼."
*   " Similarly, the integration of SQL:2023 features into commercial RDBMS could be slower than ideal. SQL standards are huge and vendors implement them partially. Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) might initially appear in a couple of leading systems (perhaps Oracle, PostgreSQL via extensions, etc.) but not uniformly across all databases by 2030. If a significant portion of relational databases do not implement SQL/PGQ by then, those systems remain unable to directly do graph queries – forcing users to either avoid using the standard (to maintain portability) or use proprietary graph solutions. That would perpetuate fragmentation. On the flip side, graph database vendors might or might not incorporate SQL/PGQ. Some might choose to support only ISO GQL and not the SQL embedding of it. So a user wanting a “unified experience” could face a split: SQL databases speaking SQL/PGQ vs. native graph databases speaking GQL. While these two are designed to be compatible at the query language level (they share the pattern syntax), they are still two different standards. It’s not yet clear if one will supersede the other or if we’ll have dual paths for years."
*   " In sum, the counterpoint is that the road to broad standard adoption might be bumpier and longer than the optimistic view assumes. By 2030, we might have standards in place but not universally adhered to. Instead of one common API for all data, we could still be managing multiple “unified” APIs – a somewhat paradoxical outcome. This would complicate the promise of a single gateway. Technical decision-makers should track standard adoption closely: it’s possible that by late decade, a lack of true industry-wide uniformity forces a reassessment of timeline or scope (e.g., maybe unify most, but not absolutely all, query types by 2030)."
