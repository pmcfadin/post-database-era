The sources present a disagreement regarding whether multi-API gateways consistently lead to less storage duplication. While some sources highlight the efficiency gains of unified storage, others point to scenarios where duplication may persist or new forms of it can emerge.

### Side 1: Gateways Lead to Less Storage Duplication

This perspective emphasizes that multi-API gateway platforms with **unified storage** significantly reduce or eliminate data duplication. By sharing a **common storage backend or data lake**, these platforms ensure that data is stored once, even when accessed through various API interfaces. This approach **avoids redundant data copies** that are common in siloed architectures, where data often needs to be copied or moved between separate engines, incurring additional storage overhead and egress fees. A unified storage solution allows a **single dataset to serve multiple access patterns**, such as block, file, or object interfaces, without creating duplicate copies. This consolidation leads to substantial space savings and improved resource utilization, with organizations reporting reductions in infrastructure storage costs by up to 50% compared to maintaining separate storage silos. The elimination of cross-system data synchronization processes also contributes to this reduction.

*   "A unified storage solution can **serve multiple access patterns from one dataset, eliminating the need for multiple stored copies**. Ceph, for instance, can expose data as block, file, or object interfaces from one backend... This means a single stored object could be read via file protocols or via S3 API without duplicating it in another silo."
*   "OpenMetal reports that by using a single Ceph-based platform, organizations “**reduce infrastructure costs by up to 50%**” versus maintaining separate storage silos."

### Side 2: Gateways May Not Fully Eliminate Storage Duplication

Conversely, this viewpoint cautions that multi-API gateways do not always fully eliminate storage duplication and can sometimes introduce new complexities or require data copies in specific situations. Some multi-model solutions, particularly those where different APIs are actually backed by **separate engines or segregated data** under a single platform, **do not automatically ensure cross-API consistency**, meaning data synchronization or duplication might still be necessary. For example, Azure Cosmos DB, despite being a multi-model offering, often **requires users to duplicate data into different containers** if they need to access the same dataset through multiple interfaces (e.g., Gremlin and SQL APIs for the same data), thereby **defeating the "single-source-of-truth" ideal**. Additionally, if a unified platform lacks certain specialized capabilities, organizations might still integrate external services (like a dedicated full-text search engine), potentially leading to additional data copies. Furthermore, the continued prevalence of polyglot persistence (using multiple specialized databases) across many enterprises also perpetuates storage duplication outside of the unified gateway.

**Strongest Citations for Side 2:**
*   "Even the flagship multi-model offerings... Cosmos DB – while supporting five APIs – requires users to pick one API per database instance, effectively siloing data by model... you’d need to **duplicate data into two containers if you truly needed both interfaces, defeating the single-source-of-truth ideal**."
*   "The caveat is that in systems where each API is actually backed by a different engine or segregated data... then **cross-API consistency is not automatic**."
*   "Of course, it assumes the unified platform is well utilized; if one still ends up **duplicating data (e.g., for safety or due to partial adoption), some costs remain**."
