# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all rows have required data"
  sample_size: "26 pricing models from 12 major vendors"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Pricing subject to change without notice"
    - "Normalization assumptions may not reflect actual workload patterns"
    - "Some instance-based pricing converted using average utilization estimates"
    - "Free tier quotas have different reset periods (monthly/daily)"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Normalized pricing uses 1KB operation assumption where applicable"
  - "Instance-based pricing converted assuming 720 hours/month and estimated ops/hour"
  - "Request Unit (RU) models show best alignment across APIs within same vendor"
  - "Significant price variance indicates lack of cross-vendor standardization"
  
# Key Findings
analysis:
  unit_alignment:
    - "Azure Cosmos DB: Perfect RU alignment across all 5 APIs"
    - "AWS: Different units per service (RCU/WCU, instance hours)"
    - "GCP: Mixed models (operations, vCPU hours, processing units)"
    - "MongoDB Atlas: Transitioning to unified request units"
  
  pricing_transparency:
    - "Request Unit models provide clearest cross-API comparison"
    - "Instance-based pricing obscures per-operation costs"
    - "Serverless models trending toward request-based units"
  
  cost_variance:
    - "10x-100x variance in normalized costs across vendors"
    - "Free tiers vary significantly in quota and reset periods"
    - "Premium services (Spanner, Neo4j) show highest per-operation costs"
