# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "95% - most entries have all required fields"
  sample_size: "84 milestone events across 7 major vendors"
  confidence: "high for manual entries, medium for scraped"
  limitations: 
    - "Preview dates may be incomplete for some vendors"
    - "Some APIs may have multiple preview phases not captured"
    - "Focus on English documentation only"
    - "Scraping limited by anti-bot measures"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Dataset designed to calculate preview-to-GA velocity as predictor of 2030 API maturity"
  - "Features prioritize multi-API and convergence capabilities over single-purpose features"
  - "Manual data represents most reliable tier; scraped data requires validation"
  - "AWS Neptune data over-represented due to successful scraping"
  - "Consider filtering by feature type for specific analyses"
  - "Preview entries are intentionally limited - many vendors don't consistently announce previews"
