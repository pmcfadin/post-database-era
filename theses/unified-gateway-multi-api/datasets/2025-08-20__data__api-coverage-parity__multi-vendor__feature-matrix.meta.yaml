# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for tracked vendors and major features"
  sample_size: "6 major vendors, 67 API combinations, 156 feature points"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Focus on major vendors only"
    - "Feature availability dates are approximate"
    - "Preview features may have changed status since data collection"
    - "Some vendor-specific terminology normalized for comparison"
  
# Analysis Insights
insights:
  key_findings:
    - "SQL APIs most universally supported (100% GA where offered)"
    - "Key-Value APIs have highest feature parity across vendors"
    - "Graph APIs concentrated in specialized vendors (Neo4j, AWS Neptune)"
    - "Search APIs increasingly common but implementation varies"
    - "Cross-API query capabilities still limited (mostly NA status)"
  vendor_patterns:
    - "AWS: Broad coverage across all paradigms, service-specific APIs"
    - "MongoDB: Strong document focus with expanding SQL and search"
    - "Azure Cosmos DB: True multi-API platform with unified backend"
    - "GCP: Service-specific APIs with limited cross-paradigm support"
    - "DataStax: CQL/Cassandra core with document and search extensions"
    - "Neo4j: Graph-specialized with emerging vector search capabilities"
  temporal_trends:
    - "2009-2012: Single-paradigm era (SQL, early NoSQL)"
    - "2013-2017: API diversification period"
    - "2018-2020: Transaction support addition across paradigms"
    - "2021-2024: Vector search and AI/ML integration wave"
    
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Data represents point-in-time snapshot as of August 2025"
  - "Preview features may have graduated to GA since collection"
  - "API naming follows vendor-service-paradigm convention"
  - "Cross-reference with individual vendor release notes for latest status"
  - "Suitable for trend analysis, competitive positioning, and convergence research"
