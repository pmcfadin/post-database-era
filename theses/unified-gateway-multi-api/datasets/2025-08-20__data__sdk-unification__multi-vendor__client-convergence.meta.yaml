# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for GitHub stats, 80% estimated for download counts"
  sample_size: "40 SDK implementations across 10 major database vendors"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Download statistics are estimated for some package registries"
    - "Unification scores based on documentation analysis and SDK architecture review"
    - "Some newer multi-modal capabilities may not be fully captured"
  
# Unification Scoring Methodology
scoring_criteria:
  score_0: "Separate SDKs per API with no shared components"
  score_1: "Separate SDKs with shared authentication/connection management"
  score_2: "Common base SDK with API-specific extensions or modules"
  score_3: "Single SDK with explicit mode switching between API types"
  score_4: "Single SDK with unified interface that abstracts API differences"
  score_5: "Single SDK with intelligent routing that automatically selects optimal API"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Download counts combine estimates from multiple package registries"
  - "Unified modes reflect documented multi-API capabilities as of August 2025"
  - "Scores reflect architectural approach rather than feature completeness"
  - "Higher scores indicate better developer experience for multi-modal applications"
  - "This data supports analysis of API convergence trends in database ecosystem"
