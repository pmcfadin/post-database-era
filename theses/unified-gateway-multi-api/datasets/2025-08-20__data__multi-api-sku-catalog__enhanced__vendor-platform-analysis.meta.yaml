  confidence: high
  limitations:
  - First listed dates verified against public announcements where possible
  - API support classification distinguishes between native, compatible, gateway,
    and plugin support
  - Gateway classification based on vendor positioning and architecture design
  - Some compatibility APIs may require additional configuration or setup
notes:
- Enhanced dataset with detailed API support classification
- Historical dates verified against press releases and official announcements
- API support categorized by implementation method (native/compatible/gateway/plugin)
- Includes vendor categorization and boolean flags for analysis
- Gateway default indicates services architecturally designed as multi-model platforms
