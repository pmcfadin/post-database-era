# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Each feature tracked from Preview announcement to GA release"
  - "Velocity calculated only for features that achieved GA"
  - "URLs point to official vendor announcements"
  - "Dates reflect public announcement timing, not internal development"
  - "Sample includes major feature releases, not minor updates"
  - "Graph and SQL features show longer maturation cycles"
  - "Search and KV features demonstrate faster velocity"
