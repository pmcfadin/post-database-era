# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "SQL:2023 focuses on multi-dimensional arrays, graph queries, and JSON features"
  - "ISO GQL (ISO/IEC 39075:2024) is the new international standard for graph queries"
  - "JSONPath (RFC 9535) provides standardized JSON query expressions"
  - "GraphQL adoption shows database API standardization trends"
  - "OpenAPI 3.x indicates REST API standardization in database services"
  - "Status definitions: GA=Generally Available, Preview=Beta/Limited, Roadmap=Planned, NA=Not Applicable"
  - "Dates represent earliest known implementation or announcement dates"
  - "Major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and enterprise databases prioritized"
