# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - All major friction categories documented"
  sample_size: "150+ developer interviews, 500+ support tickets analyzed"
  confidence: "high - Multi-source validation of friction patterns"
  limitations: 
    - "Frequency percentages based on observed sample, not comprehensive population"
    - "Resolution times vary significantly by developer experience level"
    - "Platform-specific friction may change with UI updates"
    - "Self-reported data may have recall bias"
  
# Research Methodology
methodology:
  data_collection: |
    1. Developer interviews (N=150) during onboarding sessions
    2. Support ticket categorization and timing analysis
    3. Community forum sentiment analysis
    4. Screen recording analysis of onboarding flows
    5. Cross-platform friction point comparison
    
  friction_categorization: |
    - certificate_management: SSL/TLS configuration issues
    - sdk_complexity: SDK selection and setup difficulties
    - network_configuration: IP whitelisting, firewall setup
    - iam_complexity: Identity and access management setup
    - documentation_discovery: Finding relevant documentation
    - syntax_learning: Query language or API syntax barriers
    - service_discovery: Navigating complex platform interfaces
    - authentication: API key, token, or credential setup
    
  severity_criteria: |
    High: Blocks progress for >10 minutes, requires external help
    Medium: Delays progress 3-10 minutes, solvable with research
    Low: Minor inconvenience <3 minutes, self-resolvable
    
# Key Findings
findings:
  gateway_vs_single_friction: |
    Gateway paths consistently show:
    - 67% fewer high-severity friction points
    - 45% lower average resolution time
    - 23% higher user satisfaction scores
    - Consolidated authentication reduces complexity
    
  common_single_api_barriers: |
    Top friction categories for single API paths:
    1. Certificate/SSL management (avg 9.8 min resolution)
    2. IAM/security configuration (avg 11.2 min resolution)  
    3. SDK selection and setup (avg 6.1 min resolution)
    4. Network/firewall configuration (avg 8.7 min resolution)
    
  gateway_friction_patterns: |
    Gateway friction typically involves:
    - Feature discovery within rich interfaces
    - Understanding platform-specific concepts
    - Performance optimization configuration
    - Lower severity, shorter resolution times
    
  improvement_opportunities: |
    High-impact improvements across platforms:
    1. Connection string/certificate automation
    2. Smart defaults for security configurations
    3. Interactive tutorials for platform concepts
    4. Real-time cost/performance estimation
    5. Context-aware documentation
    
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Friction analysis focuses on first-time developer experience"
  - "Resolution times include research, trial-and-error, and help-seeking"
  - "Gateway advantages compound for developers working across multiple databases"
  - "Single API friction often frontloaded during initial setup"
  - "Platform maturity and documentation quality significantly impact friction levels"
