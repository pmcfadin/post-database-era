# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for tracked preview features"
  sample_size: "16 active preview features, 3 recent GA releases"
  confidence: "high for current status, medium for predictions"
  limitations:
    - "Predictions based on historical averages only"
    - "Does not account for feature complexity variations"
    - "Limited to publicly announced previews"
    - "Vendor priorities may accelerate or delay timelines"
  
# Prediction Methodology
prediction_model:
  basis: "Historical velocity averages from companion dataset"
  aws_avg_velocity: "150 days"
  gcp_avg_velocity: "204 days" 
  azure_avg_velocity: "161 days"
  mongodb_avg_velocity: "217 days"
  datastax_avg_velocity: "186 days"
  prediction_confidence: "Medium - historical patterns may not predict future performance"

# Current Preview Analysis
current_status:
  total_active_previews: 16
  avg_days_in_preview: "~180 days (varies by feature age)"
  features_likely_ga_q1_2025: 5
  features_likely_ga_q2_2025: 8
  features_likely_ga_q3_2025: 3
  
# Vendor Preview Activity
vendor_activity:
  AWS: "4 active previews - fastest historical velocity"
  GCP: "4 active previews - longer maturation cycles"
  Azure: "3 active previews - moderate velocity"
  MongoDB: "3 active previews - longest historical cycles"
  DataStax: "2 active previews - smaller portfolio"

# API Type Distribution
api_distribution:
  Document: "6 features - highest activity area"
  SQL: "3 features - complex integrations"
  KV: "4 features - vector/AI enhancements"
  Graph: "2 features - RAG and serverless focus"
  Search: "1 feature - application templates"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Predictions based on historical velocity patterns only"
  - "Actual GA dates may vary due to technical complexity"
  - "Vector/AI features showing increased activity across vendors"
  - "Serverless capabilities common theme in current previews"
  - "Multi-cloud and edge deployment emerging trends"
  - "Updates needed as features transition to GA"
  - "Cross-reference with historical dataset for velocity context"
