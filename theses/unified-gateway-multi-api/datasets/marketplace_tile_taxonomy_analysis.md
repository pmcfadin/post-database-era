- **Placeholder Data**: Exact first-seen dates require marketplace archive access

### Research Limitations
1. Focus on major cloud marketplaces only
2. Limited to well-known database vendors
3. Historical data based on public announcements
4. Does not include cloud-native proprietary services (RDS, Cloud SQL, etc.)

### Future Research Opportunities
1. **Wayback Machine Analysis**: Systematic historical marketplace crawling
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Multi-API vs specialized database performance

## Conclusion

The marketplace tile taxonomy analysis provides compelling evidence for the database industry's transition from specialized single-purpose databases to unified multi-API platforms. With 74.4% of database services now supporting multiple APIs and 46.2% positioned as first-class platforms, the market has clearly shifted toward convergence.

This trend represents a fundamental change in how databases are positioned, sold, and consumed. The traditional category-based approach is giving way to platform-based competition, where API breadth and unified developer experience are becoming more important than specialized optimization.

The implications extend beyond vendor marketing to fundamental architecture decisions, technology strategy, and market dynamics. Organizations and technology leaders should prepare for a continued consolidation around multi-API database platforms while specialized single-purpose databases face increasing pressure to expand or risk marginalization.
