# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for traffic metrics, 95% for cost calculations"
  sample_size: "15 companies with specific egress metrics"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Egress costs calculated using AWS standard rates (may not reflect actual negotiated pricing)"
    - "Some traffic metrics estimated from percentage improvements in posts"
    - "Cross-region vs cross-AZ traffic not always distinguished"
    - "Cost savings may not account for increased compute costs of consolidated systems"
    - "Time periods for measurement vary (3-12 months post-consolidation)"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Cost calculations assume $0.12/GB egress pricing (AWS standard tier)"
  - "Focus specifically on database consolidation impact, not general architecture changes"
  - "Companies selected based on availability of specific egress traffic metrics"
  - "Particularly relevant for multi-database architectures with high inter-service communication"
  - "Egress reductions primarily from eliminating duplicate data transfers and reducing API calls"
  - "Most significant savings from companies with microservice architectures"
