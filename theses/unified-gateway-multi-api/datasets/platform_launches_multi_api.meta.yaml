# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all fields populated"
  sample_size: "31 platforms across major categories"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Launch dates are approximate for some platforms"
    - "Multi-API classification based on documented features at launch"
    - "Focus on English-language platforms and major cloud providers"
    - "Some platforms may have evolved API support post-launch"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Platform categories include: Serverless databases, Vector databases, Cloud provider services, Analytics platforms, Edge/IoT platforms"
  - "Multi-API defined as 2+ supported interfaces (SQL, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, protocol-specific)"
  - "Launch date represents general availability, not beta or preview releases"
  - "Includes both startup and enterprise vendor platforms"
  - "Useful for analyzing trends in default multi-API adoption over time"
