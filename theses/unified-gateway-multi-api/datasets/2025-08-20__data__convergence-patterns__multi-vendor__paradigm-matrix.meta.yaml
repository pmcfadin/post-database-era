    description: "Classification tier for convergence maturity"
    unit: "categorical"
    values: 
      - "Tier 1: Universal Multi-API (5 paradigms, high maturity)"
      - "Tier 2: Selective Multi-API (3-4 paradigms, good maturity)"
      - "Tier 3: Paradigm-Specialized (2 paradigms, focused approach)"
    
# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for tracked major vendors"
  sample_size: "6 major database vendors"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Scoring methodology is analytical interpretation"
    - "Tier classifications are relative to current market"
    - "Does not account for performance or cost factors"
    - "Based on feature availability, not implementation quality"
  
# Analysis Insights
insights:
  convergence_findings:
    - "83% of vendors achieved Tier 1 or Tier 2 multi-API status"
    - "All vendors support at least 2 paradigms (no single-paradigm vendors remain)"
    - "SQL + Document + Search emerges as most common paradigm combination"
    - "Graph APIs remain concentrated in specialized vendors"
  scoring_methodology:
    - "Multi-API score combines paradigm count, feature completeness, and GA ratio"
    - "Higher scores indicate more mature multi-paradigm platforms"
    - "Tier 1 vendors score >0.80 with 5 paradigms"
    - "Tier 2 vendors score 0.65-0.80 with 3-4 paradigms"
  strategic_implications:
    - "Multi-API capability is now competitive necessity"
    - "Specialized vendors must expand or risk marginalization" 
    - "Platform consolidation opportunities significant for enterprises"
    - "Cross-API query engines become differentiating capability"
    
# Usage Notes
