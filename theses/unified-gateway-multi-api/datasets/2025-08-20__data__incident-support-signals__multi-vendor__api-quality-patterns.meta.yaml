  credibility: Tier B - Mixed synthetic and real patterns
characteristics:
  rows: 1008
  columns: 8
  time_range: 2023-Q1 - 2024-Q4
  update_frequency: static
  collection_method: automated + synthetic patterns
columns:
  vendor:
    type: string
    description: Service provider or platform vendor
    unit: categorical
  api:
    type: string
    description: API type (SQL, KV, Document, Graph, Search, Multi-API Gateway)
    unit: categorical

  source:
    type: string
    description: Data source (status pages, GitHub, Stack Overflow, synthetic)

    type: string
    description: Brief incident description or title
    unit: text
quality:
  completeness: 95%
  sample_size: Multi-source aggregation
  confidence: medium
  limitations:
  - Some data is synthetic based on industry patterns
  - GitHub API rate limits may affect completeness
  - Stack Overflow data filtered for problem signals only
  - Status page data may be incomplete for older incidents
notes:
- Combines real incident data with synthetic patterns based on industry research
- Gateway-specific incidents are primarily synthetic due to limited public data
- Data designed to support research on unified gateway vs individual API quality
- Issue classification based on text analysis patterns
- Vendor multipliers applied based on known reliability patterns
