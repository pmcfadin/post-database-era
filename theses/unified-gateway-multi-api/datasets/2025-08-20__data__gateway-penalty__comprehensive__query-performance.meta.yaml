# Key Research Findings
findings:
  primary_hypothesis:
    claim: "Gateway abstraction overhead ≤10% for majority of common queries"
    result: "62.9% of benchmarks show ≤10% overhead"
    status: "Partially supported - significant portion under threshold"
  
  platform_insights:
    - "AWS DynamoDB shows most consistent low overhead (5-10%)"
    - "DataStax Astra shows highest overhead due to CQL gateway complexity"
    - "Azure Cosmos DB varies by API type (SQL vs DocumentDB)"
    - "MongoDB Atlas gateway overhead moderate but consistent"
    - "Neo4j unified API overhead reasonable for graph workloads"
  
  workload_insights:
    - "Simple operations (GET, lookup) show lowest overhead"
    - "Complex operations (JOIN, cross-API) show higher but still reasonable overhead"
    - "Bulk operations show moderate overhead"
    - "Transaction overhead highest but still under 20%"
