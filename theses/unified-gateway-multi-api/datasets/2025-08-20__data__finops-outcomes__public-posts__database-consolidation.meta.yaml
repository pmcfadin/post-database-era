# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% for core fields, 95% for links (some engineering blogs have moved)"
  sample_size: "25 companies across different industries and scales"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Self-reported metrics from engineering teams may have selection bias"
    - "Different companies measure costs differently (infrastructure vs total cost)"
    - "Timeframes for measuring outcomes vary (6 months to 2 years post-implementation)"
    - "Some cost figures estimated from percentage improvements mentioned in posts"
    - "Limited counterexamples where consolidation increased costs"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Delta percentages calculated from before/after costs where both provided"
  - "Some entries extrapolated from operational metrics (e.g., DBA count reduction)"
  - "WeWork entry included as counterexample showing consolidation can increase costs"
  - "Validation status indicates confidence level in reported figures"
  - "Focus on infrastructure and operational cost impacts, not development velocity"
  - "Most sources from 2019-2021 period when database consolidation became mainstream"
  - "Companies selected based on public availability of specific cost metrics"
