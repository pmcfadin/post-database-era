# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Gateway-based services (Supabase, PlanetScale, Vercel) show 2-3 step flows"
  - "Traditional cloud providers require 5-6 steps with CLI/SDK installation"
  - "Account setup represents 15-25% of total onboarding time"
  - "Tool installation steps add 5+ minutes per onboarding flow"
  - "Console-only workflows reduce barrier to first query execution"
  - "Step categories reveal friction points: tool_installation, authentication, configuration"
