# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all tools researched have complete data"
  sample_size: "16 major tools across 3 categories"
  confidence: "high"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Gateway support indicates ability to connect through unified APIs rather than individual database APIs"
  - "API modes show which protocols the tool can use for connections"
  - "Query engines are inherently gateway-like tools themselves"
  - "BI tools show mixed adoption - enterprise tools lead in gateway support"
  - "ETL tools are transitioning from point-to-point to gateway-mediated connections"
  - "Related to unified gateway adoption trends and database consolidation patterns"
