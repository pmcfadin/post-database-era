# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all pathway types represented"
  sample_size: "5 pathway categories"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Cognitive load and abandonment risk are estimated metrics"
    - "Conversion efficiency based on industry patterns, not empirical data"
    - "Individual developer experience may vary significantly"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Gateway approaches show 65% reduction in time-to-first-query vs traditional single-API"
  - "Console-only pathways eliminate CLI barrier for 40% of developers"
  - "Cognitive load correlates inversely with conversion efficiency"
  - "Modern cloud-native services prioritize developer velocity over feature completeness"
  - "Traditional providers may be optimizing for enterprise adoption rather than developer experience"
  - "Serverless gateway pattern represents emerging best practice for developer onboarding"
