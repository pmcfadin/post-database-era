# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% (all required fields populated)"
  sample_size: "28 migration tools/guides"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Community tools maintenance status may change rapidly"
    - "Last updated dates based on documentation timestamps"
    - "Some beta/alpha tools may have limited production readiness"
    - "URLs may become outdated as vendor documentation restructures"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Production maturity indicates vendor-supported, enterprise-ready solutions"
  - "Beta/Alpha maturity typically indicates community or experimental tools"
  - "Multi-API gateways provide abstraction layers rather than direct migration"
  - "Cross-vendor migrations often require custom scripting beyond provided tools"
  - "Maintained=False indicates stale or abandoned community projects"
  - "Focus on 2022-2025 timeframe reflects recent migration tool ecosystem"
