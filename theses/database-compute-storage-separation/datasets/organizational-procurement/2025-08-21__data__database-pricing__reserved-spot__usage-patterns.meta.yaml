# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "10 major database workload types"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: ["Specific percentages vary by cloud provider and region", "Cost savings depend on current market rates", "Availability targets may not account for application-level resilience"]
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "OLTP workloads favor reserved instances for predictable performance"
  - "Analytics workloads can leverage spot instances for batch processing"
  - "Cost predictability inversely correlates with spot usage percentage"
  - "Cache layers show highest spot usage due to ephemeral nature"
  - "Storage reserved capacity most beneficial for persistent, growing datasets"
  - "Failover times critical for determining spot instance suitability"
