# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "10 major database vendor categories"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: ["Specific contract terms vary significantly by enterprise size", "Some terms are based on publicly available pricing rather than actual contracts", "Rapidly evolving pricing models may not reflect latest changes"]
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Commitment amounts are representative of mid-market enterprise deals"
  - "Overage multipliers reflect penalty for exceeding committed usage"
  - "Independence ratings: yes=fully independent, partial=some coupling, no=tightly coupled"
  - "Cross-region portability crucial for multi-cloud strategies"
