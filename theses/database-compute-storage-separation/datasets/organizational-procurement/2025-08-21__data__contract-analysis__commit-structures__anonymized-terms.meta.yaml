# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Tier 1-5 represent traditional enterprise contract progression"
  - "Cloud native vendors offer more flexible, consumption-based terms"
  - "Overage multipliers create incentive for accurate capacity planning"
  - "Cross-service credits enable compute/storage optimization arbitrage"
  - "Bursting thresholds vary widely based on workload predictability"
  - "Support tiers often bundled but may be separately negotiable"
