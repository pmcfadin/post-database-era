# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "10 representative FinOps implementation patterns"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: ["Implementation effectiveness varies significantly by organizational culture", "Metrics may not capture full complexity of enterprise cost allocation", "Satisfaction scores subjective and vary by stakeholder role"]
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Higher tagging coverage correlates with better chargeback accuracy"
  - "Usage proportional model shows highest accuracy but requires most automation"
  - "Showback only models have lower accuracy but higher organizational acceptance"
  - "Spot usage inversely correlates with cost predictability"
  - "Full chargeback implementations require strong executive sponsorship"
  - "Automation score reflects both technical capability and process maturity"
