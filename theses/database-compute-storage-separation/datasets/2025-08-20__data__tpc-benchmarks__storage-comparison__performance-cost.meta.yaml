# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all benchmark configurations documented"
  sample_size: "7 representative benchmark configurations"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Benchmark results may not reflect real-world workload patterns"
    - "Optimizations specific to benchmark queries may not generalize"
    - "Cost calculations based on list pricing without enterprise discounts"
    - "Performance sensitive to specific hardware and configuration choices"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Local NVMe provides 2-3x better TPC-C performance due to latency sensitivity"
  - "Object storage shows competitive TPC-H performance per dollar"
  - "Serverless options (Athena, BigQuery) have high per-query costs but zero idle costs"
  - "Aurora provides good balance of performance and managed service benefits"
  - "Storage type impact varies significantly between OLTP and OLAP workloads"
