# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "Industry standard benchmarks"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Vendor specifications may be optimistic"
    - "Real-world performance varies with workload patterns"
    - "Network conditions affect remote storage performance"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Latency measurements assume 4KB random read operations"
  - "Network storage latency includes protocol overhead"
  - "RDMA requires specialized network infrastructure"
  - "Cloud storage performance varies by region and availability zone"
