# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100%"
  sample_size: "Major cloud provider regions"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Latency measurements include database protocol overhead"
  - "Multi-AZ deployments trade performance for availability"
  - "Cross-region penalties are substantial but enable disaster recovery"
  - "Strong consistency models amplify latency impact"
  - "Bandwidth limitations become critical for large transactions"
  - "Provider-specific optimizations (Aurora Global Database, Spanner) can reduce penalties"
