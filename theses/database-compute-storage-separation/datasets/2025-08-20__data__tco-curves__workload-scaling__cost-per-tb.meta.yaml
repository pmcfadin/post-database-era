# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - complete TCO breakdown for all scenarios"
  sample_size: "7 representative workload sizes"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "TCO estimates based on typical enterprise configurations"
    - "Operational costs vary significantly by organization"
    - "Does not include migration or training costs"
    - "Assumes steady-state operations after initial setup"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Clear scale economies favor disaggregated storage at 10TB+"
  - "Small workloads (< 1TB) may be cost-competitive on local storage"
  - "Operational cost savings are significant for managed services"
  - "Data transfer costs become material at large scale"
  - "1PB+ workloads are only viable with disaggregated architecture"
  - "Cost per TB decreases with scale for disaggregated storage"
