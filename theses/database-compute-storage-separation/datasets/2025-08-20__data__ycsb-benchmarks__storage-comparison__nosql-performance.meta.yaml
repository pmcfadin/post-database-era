# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all YCSB workload patterns covered"
  sample_size: "6 representative NoSQL configurations"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "YCSB workloads are synthetic and may not reflect real application patterns"
    - "Database-specific optimizations can significantly impact results"
    - "Network latency between client and database not consistently controlled"
    - "Cost calculations based on sustained performance, not peak bursts"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Local NVMe provides 50-60% better latency for write-heavy workloads"
  - "Read-heavy workloads show smaller performance gaps between storage types"
  - "DynamoDB managed service provides good performance despite network storage"
  - "Redis on local storage excels for read-heavy, low-latency requirements"
  - "Cost per operation varies significantly based on workload characteristics"
  - "Managed services reduce operational complexity but may increase per-operation costs"
