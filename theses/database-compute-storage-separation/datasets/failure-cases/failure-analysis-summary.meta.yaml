# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - synthesizes data from 19 individual failure cases"
  sample_size: "4 distinct failure categories covering major constraint types"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: ["Summary analysis may lose some case-specific nuances", "Impact ranges reflect variability across cases"]
