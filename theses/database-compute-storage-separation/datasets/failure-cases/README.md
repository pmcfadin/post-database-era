# Compute-Storage Separation Failure Cases

This directory contains comprehensive documentation of cases where compute-storage separation fails to meet requirements or becomes economically infeasible. The analysis covers four primary failure categories with 19 documented cases.

| `write-amplification-failures.csv` | 4 | Performance | Write-heavy workload degradation |
| `data-residency-constraints.csv` | 5 | Compliance | Regulatory and legal constraints |
| `edge-deployment-challenges.csv` | 6 | Infrastructure | Network and resource limitations |
| `failure-analysis-summary.csv` | 4 | Analysis | Cross-category pattern analysis |

## Key Findings

### 1. Ultra-Low Latency Failures (Critical Severity)
- **Primary Constraint**: Physics - speed of light limitations
- **Industries Affected**: Financial trading, Gaming, Industrial IoT, Medical devices
- **Impact**: 10-100x latency increase makes applications non-competitive or unsafe
- **No Technical Workaround**: Fundamental physical limitations cannot be overcome

### 2. Write Amplification Failures (High Severity)  
- **Primary Constraint**: Network bandwidth and protocol overhead
- **Industries Affected**: E-commerce, Data processing, IoT platforms, Analytics
- **Impact**: 2-10x write amplification, 30-80% performance loss, 150-400% cost increase
- **Limited Workarounds**: Write buffering helps but adds complexity and risk

### 3. Data Residency Constraints (Critical Severity)
- **Primary Constraint**: Legal and regulatory compliance requirements
- **Industries Affected**: Healthcare, Finance, Government, Technology
- **Impact**: Complete architectural inflexibility, 20-200% cost increase
- **Workarounds**: Regional deployment only, limited global optimization

### 4. Edge Deployment Challenges (High Severity)
- **Primary Constraint**: Network connectivity reliability and bandwidth
- **Industries Affected**: Manufacturing, Retail, Research, Military, Healthcare  
- **Impact**: Complete system unavailability during outages, 100-1000% cost increase
- **Workarounds**: Local replica with synchronization (adds complexity)

## Economic Impact Summary

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Market competitiveness loss, safety risks
- **Write Amplification**: 150-400% operational cost increase
- **Data Residency**: 20-200% infrastructure cost increase, limited vendor choice
- **Edge Deployment**: 100-1000% infrastructure cost increase for local redundancy

## Evidence Quality

- **High Evidence Strength**: 13 cases with strong documentation
- **Medium Evidence Strength**: 6 cases with reasonable documentation
- **Sources**: Academic papers, industry benchmarks, regulatory documentation, deployment case studies

## Research Methodology

1. **Systematic Search**: Targeted searches for documented failure cases across four constraint categories
2. **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-referenced findings across academic, industry, and regulatory sources
3. **Impact Quantification**: Documented both technical performance impacts and economic costs
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Identified systematic limitations and root causes

## Usage Notes

- All datasets include comprehensive metadata files (`.meta.yaml`)
- Case IDs provide unique identification across the failure case collection
- Evidence strength indicates reliability of source documentation
- Cost impacts are representative ranges that vary by specific implementation

## Implications for Database Architecture

These failure cases demonstrate that compute-storage separation is not universally applicable:

1. **Physical Constraints**: Some applications have latency requirements that cannot be met by any remote storage architecture
2. **Economic Constraints**: Write-heavy workloads may become cost-prohibitive with separation overhead
3. **Legal Constraints**: Regulatory requirements may mandate specific architectural approaches
4. **Infrastructure Constraints**: Some deployment environments cannot support reliable connectivity to remote storage

The documented failures provide important counter-evidence to claims that compute-storage separation is always beneficial or feasible.
