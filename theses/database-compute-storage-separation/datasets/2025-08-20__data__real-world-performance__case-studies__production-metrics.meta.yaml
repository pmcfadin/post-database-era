# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all case studies fully documented"
  sample_size: "8 production deployments from major companies"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Cost estimates may not include all operational overhead"
    - "Performance metrics represent specific time periods and may vary"
    - "Companies may have enterprise pricing not reflected in public costs"
    - "Some metrics estimated based on partial information disclosed"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Local storage preferred for mission-critical, latency-sensitive applications"
  - "Object storage excels for analytical workloads and batch processing"
  - "Serverless options (BigQuery) provide excellent cost efficiency for analytics"
  - "High-volume OLTP systems consistently choose local storage for predictable latency"
  - "Data lake architectures universally use object storage for cost efficiency"
  - "Availability requirements often drive storage architecture decisions"
  - "Cost per query varies dramatically between OLTP and OLAP use cases"
