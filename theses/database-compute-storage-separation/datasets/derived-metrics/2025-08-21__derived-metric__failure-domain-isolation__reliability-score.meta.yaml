# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all reliability metrics evaluated"
  sample_size: "15 representative database architectures"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "MTTR data based on vendor claims and public incident reports"
    - "Failure scenarios may not cover all possible edge cases"
    - "Scoring methodology weights all factors equally"
    - "Regional differences in infrastructure reliability not fully captured"
  
# Scoring Methodology
scoring:
  multi_az_score:
    - "25 points: Full multi-AZ with automatic failover"
    - "15 points: Multi-AZ with manual intervention"
    - "5 points: Multi-AZ capable but not default"
    - "0 points: Single AZ only"
  blast_radius_score:
    - "25 points: Failure limited to single instance/node"
    - "20 points: Failure limited to single region"
    - "15 points: Failure limited to cluster/service"
    - "10 points: Failure affects multiple clusters"
    - "5 points: Systemic failure possible"
  mttr_score:
    - "25 points: <15 minutes MTTR"
    - "22 points: 15-20 minutes MTTR"
    - "20 points: 20-30 minutes MTTR"
    - "15 points: 30-60 minutes MTTR"
    - "10 points: 60-90 minutes MTTR"
    - "<10 points: >90 minutes MTTR"
  stateless_score:
    - "25 points: Fully stateless compute with instant replacement"
    - "15 points: Partially stateless with cache warm-up required"
    - "5 points: Stateful but supports failover"
    - "0 points: Stateful with no automatic failover"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Scores >90 indicate excellent failure domain isolation"
  - "Scores 70-90 indicate good failure domain isolation"
  - "Scores 50-70 indicate moderate failure domain isolation"
  - "Scores <50 indicate poor failure domain isolation"
  - "Separated architectures generally score higher than coupled architectures"
  - "Global/multi-region services show highest isolation scores"
  - "Traditional coupled systems show lowest isolation scores"
  - "Serverless architectures benefit most from stateless compute scoring"
