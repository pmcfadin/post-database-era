# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all cost metrics available"
  sample_size: "15 representative workload patterns"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Cost calculations based on list pricing, not negotiated enterprise rates"
    - "Does not include data transfer costs for multi-region deployments"
    - "Some services have minimum billing increments not reflected in hourly averages"
    - "Storage costs assumed constant but may have tiering effects"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Higher utilization lift per QPS indicates better cost efficiency from separation"
  - "Batch processing workloads show highest utilization lift (0.175-0.840)"
  - "Traditional monolithic systems show zero utilization lift"
  - "Serverless and disaggregated architectures enable highest cost savings"
  - "Time-series and columnar databases show strong utilization lift due to workload characteristics"
  - "Cache-based workloads show lower utilization lift due to memory requirements"
  - "Values can be used to calculate ROI of migration to separated architectures"
