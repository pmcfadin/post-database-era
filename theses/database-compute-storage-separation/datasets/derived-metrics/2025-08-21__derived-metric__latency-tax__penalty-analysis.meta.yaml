# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all required measurements available"
  sample_size: "15 representative database/workload combinations"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Some measurements are vendor-provided specifications rather than independent benchmarks"
    - "Network conditions can vary significantly in production"
    - "Cache hit rates not normalized across comparisons"
    - "Does not account for write amplification in some storage types"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Latency tax >1000% indicates severe performance penalty for separation"
  - "Latency tax <100% indicates reasonable performance penalty for separation"
  - "OLTP workloads generally show highest latency sensitivity"
  - "Analytical workloads (OLAP) show more tolerance to latency tax"
  - "Cache-heavy workloads (Redis) show significant degradation with network storage"
  - "Vector and search workloads show moderate latency tax tolerance"
  - "Results should be compared against tolerance_threshold_ms for workload viability assessment"
