# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all required fields populated"
  sample_size: "15 representative organization types"
  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: 
    - "Based on simulated scaling patterns from real pricing models"
    - "30-day observation window may not capture seasonal patterns"
    - "Some vendor telemetry data estimated from public benchmarks"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "SE Index > 0.5 indicates high separation elasticity (frequent independent scaling)"
  - "SE Index < 0.2 indicates low separation elasticity (mostly coupled scaling)"
  - "Values normalized across different database types and workload patterns"
  - "Gaming, analytics, and serverless workloads show highest separation elasticity"
  - "Traditional ERP and legacy systems show lowest separation elasticity"
