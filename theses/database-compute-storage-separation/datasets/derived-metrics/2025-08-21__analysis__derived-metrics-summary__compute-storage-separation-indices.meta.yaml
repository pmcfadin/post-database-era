# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all derived metrics included"
  sample_size: "75 total data points across 5 metrics"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations: 
    - "Metrics measured across different time periods and contexts"
    - "Some thresholds based on industry best practices rather than hard limits"
    - "Cross-metric correlations not fully explored"
    - "Regional and industry-specific variations not normalized"
  
# Key Findings Summary
findings:
  separation_elasticity:
    - "Mean SE of 0.427 indicates moderate adoption of independent scaling"
    - "High variability (std dev 0.196) shows workload-dependent effectiveness"
    - "Serverless and gaming workloads lead adoption"
  latency_tax:
    - "Mean latency tax of 2654% indicates severe performance penalties"
    - "OLTP workloads particularly affected by remote storage"
    - "Sub-millisecond requirements often incompatible with separation"
  utilization_lift:
    - "Mean lift of $0.067 per QPS shows significant cost savings potential"
    - "Batch processing workloads show 10x higher efficiency gains"
    - "Traditional monolithic systems show zero utilization lift"
  failure_domain_isolation:
    - "Mean score of 76.3 indicates good reliability benefits from separation"
    - "Separated architectures consistently outperform coupled systems"
    - "Stateless compute provides significant reliability advantages"
  data_gravity_index:
    - "Mean index of 8486 indicates moderate data movement penalties"
    - "Cross-region scenarios face substantial cost implications"
    - "Data locality remains critical factor for separation viability"
  
# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Use threshold ranges to evaluate separation viability for specific workloads"
  - "High standard deviations indicate context-dependent metric performance"
  - "Consider all 5 metrics together for comprehensive separation assessment"
  - "Metrics should be weighted based on workload priorities (cost vs performance vs reliability)"
  - "Regular metric monitoring recommended for production separation implementations"
