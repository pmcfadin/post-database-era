# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all rows have complete data"
  sample_size: "10 representative storage configurations"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Costs based on list pricing, actual costs may vary with discounts"
    - "Performance metrics are theoretical maximums, not sustained performance"
    - "Workload-specific optimizations may significantly impact results"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Local NVMe shows 10-100x better IOPS but higher cost per TB"
  - "Disaggregated storage offers better elasticity and lower TCO at scale"
  - "Aurora Serverless provides best balance of performance and cost efficiency"
  - "Object storage (S3) has highest latency but lowest storage costs"
