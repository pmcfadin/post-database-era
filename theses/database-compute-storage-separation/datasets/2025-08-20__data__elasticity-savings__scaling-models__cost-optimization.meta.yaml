# Quality Indicators
quality:
  completeness: "100% - all scaling scenarios covered"
  sample_size: "8 representative scaling patterns"
  confidence: "high"
  limitations:
    - "Cost estimates based on typical enterprise workload patterns"
    - "Actual savings depend on specific workload characteristics"
    - "Does not include data transfer costs between regions"
    - "Assumes optimal configuration and utilization"

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Disaggregated scaling shows 16-58% cost savings vs monolithic"
  - "Serverless models (Aurora, PlanetScale) provide highest savings"
  - "BigQuery serverless model offers excellent price/performance"
  - "Traditional monolithic scaling forces over-provisioning of unused resources"
  - "Cost savings increase with workload variability"
