quality:
  completeness: 100% - All fields populated based on available pricing information
  confidence: High - Based on current published pricing
  limitations:
  - Pricing subject to frequent changes
  - Promotional pricing not reflected
  - Regional pricing variations not captured
  - Volume discounts not included
notes:
- 'Decoupling score methodology: Independent pricing (30pts) + No minimum storage
  (20pts) + Autoscaling (25pts) + Billing granularity (15pts) + Elastic scaling (10pts)'
- Pricing collected from official vendor sources
- Focus on standard pricing tiers, not enterprise or custom pricing
- Scores reflect architectural and pricing independence
