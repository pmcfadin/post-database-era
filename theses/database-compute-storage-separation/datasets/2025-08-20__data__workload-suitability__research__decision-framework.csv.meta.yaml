  title: Workload Suitability Decision Framework
  topic: database-compute-storage-separation
notes:
- Weights sum to 1.0 for scoring calculations
- Use as starting point - adjust weights for specific context
- Consider multiple factors together, not in isolation
quality:
  completeness: 100%
  confidence: high
  limitations:
  - Weights may need adjustment based on specific organizational priorities
