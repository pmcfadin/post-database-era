Here’s a falsifiable research question set, structured by sub-theme, written to drive your pipeline forward:

⸻

1. Separation of Compute and Storage
	•	Do major DB vendors ship products with independent compute and storage scaling by 2030?
	•	Are >50% of new DB deployments in cloud-native orgs using disaggregated compute/storage by 2035?
	•	Do cloud buyers list independent scaling of compute/storage as a top-3 requirement in RFPs?
	•	Do storage-only upgrades occur without compute downtime in >70% of production systems?

⸻

2. Storage as the System of Record
	•	By 2030, do >50% of analytics queries run directly on Parquet/Iceberg vs DB-native formats?
	•	Do enterprises cite object storage as the “primary source of truth” in >40% of IT surveys by 2035?
	•	Are >60% of new ETL pipelines writing directly to lake tables instead of DB storage engines?
	•	Do compliance audits treat object storage logs as authoritative records in >50% of cases?

⸻

3. Compute as Ephemeral / Elastic
	•	Are >70% of DB query engines in cloud-native orgs deployed as ephemeral serverless compute by 2035?
	•	Do autoscaling compute pools replace >50% of traditional DB clusters in production by 2030?
	•	Do cost reports show compute accounting for >80% of short-term workload variance vs storage?
	•	Do users provision DB compute only at query time in >40% of managed deployments?

⸻

4. Network as the Glue
	•	Do >60% of DB performance SLAs in 2030 cite interconnect latency/bandwidth as the top bottleneck?
	•	Are cloud DB vendors charging separately for network egress in >70% of managed SKUs by 2030?
	•	Do benchmarks show network overhead >20% of end-to-end query latency in disaggregated DBs?
	•	Are multi-region deployments gated more by interconnect limits than storage/compute by 2035?

⸻

5. Industry Transformation by 2035
	•	Do analyst reports project DB revenue split by “compute vs storage” line items instead of “engine type”?
	•	Are >50% of cloud-native vendors marketing “database as compute + storage SKU” by 2035?
	•	Do DB job postings list storage formats (e.g., Parquet, Iceberg) more than vendor engines by 2035?
	•	Are >40% of DB consolidations driven by desire to unify storage across engines by 2035?
