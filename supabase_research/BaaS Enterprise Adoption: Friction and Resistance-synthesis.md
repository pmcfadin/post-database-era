The sources present differing perspectives on the extent of organizational resistance faced by BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) platforms like Supabase within enterprises. While one source highlights BaaS as having the lowest friction generally, another details significant barriers that limit its full enterprise adoption.

### BaaS Offers Lowest Friction (Generally)

One perspective suggests that **BaaS platforms generally encounter the lowest enterprise friction** when compared to HTAP systems and Multi-modal databases. This is primarily attributed to their **developer-driven adoption** and their capacity for **rapid proof-of-value demonstration**. BaaS also typically involves **lower initial investment requirements**. These factors enable quicker pilot phases (2-6 weeks) and faster production deployments (3-9 months). Although this view acknowledges that **governance and compliance concerns can limit full enterprise adoption**, it emphasizes the inherent ease of initial adoption and strong developer advocacy as key drivers reducing overall organizational resistance.

### BaaS Faces Significant Resistance

Conversely, another perspective details that **BaaS platforms encounter substantial organizational resistance** in enterprises, often limiting their widespread and full-scale adoption. Key limiting factors include **enterprise resistance to vendor lock-in**, which is cited as a primary concern by 73% of enterprises. Furthermore, significant **regulatory and compliance complexities** act as barriers, with reported gaps in HIPAA compliance, lack of FedRAMP certification, and challenges with GDPR implementation. **Performance and scalability limitations** are also critical obstacles for large-scale enterprise workloads, exemplified by a typical ceiling of ~100K concurrent connections and PostgreSQL scalability limits for massive datasets. These technical and regulatory concerns, combined with **organizational change resistance** related to retraining development teams and navigating IT governance conflicts, collectively contribute to significant friction.
