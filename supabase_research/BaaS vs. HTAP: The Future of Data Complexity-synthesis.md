The sources present a disagreement on whether the inherent low technical complexity of BaaS platforms will enable them to universally "take over" the application data market, or if the specialized, higher technical complexities of HTAP and Multi-modal databases necessitate their continued distinct evolution for specific enterprise workloads.

### Side 1: BaaS's Low Complexity and Developer Experience Will Lead to Dominance

This perspective emphasizes that BaaS platforms, like Supabase, offer the **lowest technical complexity and highest developer productivity**, making them ideal for rapid application development and addressing key enterprise pain points such as operational complexity. It suggests that this simplicity and developer-first approach will drive significant market capture in new application development, with the potential for these platforms to evolve and **become the default choice for all application data needs** by overcoming current performance and scalability limitations through substantial investment and architectural enhancements.

### Side 2: Specialized Technical Complexity Prevents Universal Consolidation

This view contends that while BaaS is simpler for developers, the **inherent, specialized complexities** of HTAP and Multi-modal databases are fundamental to their superior performance and capabilities for specific, demanding workloads, preventing a single, low-complexity BaaS from becoming universal. HTAP systems, for instance, are noted for their "highest complexity, requires specialized expertise" due to their design for real-time analytics. Attempts by BaaS to absorb these capabilities face **significant technical challenges** related to performance, scaling, and multi-model optimization, indicating that the market will evolve toward "specialized integration" rather than "universal consolidation."
