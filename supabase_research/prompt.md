Supabase has become the defacto database for engineers using agentic coding. I want to research the size of that market and the applicability to the large enterprise market. By combining elements needed for an application, data, auth and file storage, they provide the "just works" basics for app building. What other elements would need to be present for enterprise adoption. 

Research this market potential with evidence. This is my thesis" "The model supabase has created will be duplicated and take over the application data market by 2030 spawning many competitors and product alignment"
