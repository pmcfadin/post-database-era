  confidence: "medium"
  limitations: ["Based on selective case studies and testimonials", "Highly dependent on developer skill level", "Use case complexity varies significantly"]

# Usage Notes
notes:
  - "Supabase optimized for rapid prototyping and MVP development"
  - "SingleStore focused on enterprise performance over development speed"
  - "Time measurements vary significantly based on developer experience"
  - "Productivity gains most pronounced for PostgreSQL-familiar developers (Supabase)"
  - "Enterprise implementations require more planning but offer greater scalability"
